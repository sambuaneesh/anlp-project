# GraphFC Framework: Comprehensive Evaluation Summary

## Executive Summary

This report presents a complete evaluation of the GraphFC (Graph-based Fact-Checking) framework on real-world datasets, revealing critical insights about multi-hop reasoning limitations in automated fact-checking systems.

## Key Results Overview

### Dataset Scope
- **Total Samples**: 2,208 (PHD_benchmark + WikiBio datasets)
- **Evaluation Coverage**: Complete dataset (train + validation + test)
- **Real Execution Time**: 374.05 seconds total

### Performance Results

| Reasoning Complexity | Samples | Accuracy | F1-Score | Avg Runtime |
|---------------------|---------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Single-hop (1)**     | 1       | 0.000    | 0.000    | 0.074s     |
| **Multi-hop (2)**      | 31      | 0.516    | 0.380    | 0.118s     |
| **Multi-hop (3+)**     | 2,176   | 0.373    | 0.286    | 0.170s     |
| **Overall**            | 2,208   | **0.375** | **0.287** | **0.169s** |

## Critical Findings

### 1. Multi-Hop Reasoning Dominance
- **98.6% of real-world claims** require complex multi-hop reasoning (3+ steps)
- Only 1.4% can be solved with simple 2-hop reasoning
- Demonstrates the complexity of real fact-checking scenarios

### 2. Significant Performance Degradation
- **Accuracy drops from 51.6% to 37.3%** as complexity increases from 2-hop to 3+-hop
- **GraphFC (37.5%) performs worse than Random baseline (44.6%)**
- Confidence scores decrease with complexity (0.482 → 0.329)

### 3. Contextual Dependency Failure
- Framework treats each claim independently
- No memory or context sharing between reasoning steps
- Results in fragmented reasoning and poor performance

### 4. Computational Overhead
- Real runtime: 0.169 seconds per sample
- Significantly slower than baseline methods (near 0s)
- Scalability concerns for large-scale deployment

## Comparison with Baseline Methods

| Method | Accuracy | F1-Score | Runtime | Performance |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Random** | 44.6% | 43.7% | ~0s | **Better than GraphFC** |
| Keyword | 0.9% | 1.2% | ~0s | Poor |
| Simple | 40.4% | 27.1% | ~0s | Competitive |
| **GraphFC** | **37.5%** | **28.7%** | **374s** | **Underperforms** |

## Research Implications

### For Academic Research
1. **Multi-hop reasoning** requires fundamental algorithmic improvements
2. **Contextual memory** mechanisms are essential for complex reasoning
3. **Real-world evaluation** reveals different challenges than synthetic datasets

## Conclusions

This comprehensive evaluation reveals that **current graph-based fact-checking approaches face fundamental challenges** when applied to real-world scenarios:

1. **Multi-hop reasoning limitation**: Most real claims require complex reasoning where current methods fail
2. **Contextual dependency gap**: Independent processing of claims prevents coherent reasoning
3. **Performance paradox**: Complex methods underperform simple baselines
4. **Scalability issues**: Computational overhead limits practical deployment

**The research demonstrates the critical need for new approaches** that can effectively handle contextual dependencies and multi-hop reasoning in automated fact-checking systems.
