    "evidence": "George John Kurowski (April 19, 1918 – December 9, 1999) was a third baseman in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the St. Louis Cardinals (1949). Kurowski batted and threw right-handed. He debuted on September 23, 1941, and played his final game on October 1, 1949. In a nine-season career, Kurowski posted a .286 batting average with 106 home runs and 529 RBI in 916 games played. Kurowski's childhood nickname came from his already white hair. A native of Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski overcame several personal problems. He overcame childhood osteomyelitis, which made him miss a part of a bone on his right forearm. Before he started his baseball career, his older brother died in a mine accident, and his father died from a heart attack during spring training in 1942. His most productive season came in 1945, when he posted career-highs in average (.310), home runs (27), RBI (104), runs (108), doubles (27), slugging percentage (.544) and on-base percentage (.420). An All-Star during five consecutive seasons (1943–47), Kurowski exceeded the 20 home run mark three times to set a major league record for a third baseman (1944–45, 1947), and hit over .300 three times (1945–47). He also led the National League three times in putouts, twice in fielding percentage, and once in double plays. In four World Series appearances, Kurowski hit .253 (21-for-83) with one home run and nine RBI in 23 games, as the Cardinals were world champions in 1942, 1944 and 1946. His only home run in the series, in 1942, off Red Ruffing, broke a 2–2 tie in the ninth inning of Game Five to clinch the title for St. Louis over the New York Yankees. He also appeared five times in the MVP ballot, in 1942 and from 1944 through 1947. In 1949, Kurowski developed arm and elbow problems and his playing career ended. After that, he coached and managed in the minor leagues for 18 years until 1972. He gained induction into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame in 1988. In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \"All-Time All-Star Argument Starter,\" consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Kurowski was the third baseman on Stein's Polish team. Kurowski died in Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania, at age 81.",

Although he is perhaps most frequently associated with Winger, Taylor has also played with numerous other prominent musicians, including future Sammy Hagar and Boston guitarist Gary Pihl (in his early days), Eric Martin (solo artist and future Mr. Big frontman), Aldo Nova, Steve Perry of Journey, Alice Cooper, and Tommy Shaw.\n\nTaylor experienced his first mainstream success in the early 1980s as the touring keyboardist in Canadian musician Aldo Nova's backing band, and he appears in the music video for Nova's biggest hit, \"Fantasy.\" Prior to forming Winger, Taylor and Kip Winger were both playing with Alice Cooper's backing band on the tours for Cooper's mid-80s albums, \"Constrictor\" (1986) and \"Raise Your Fist and Yell\" (1987). During this time, the two began composing songs together and, while on break from touring, recorded what would become the first Winger demos. Whereas Kip left Alice's band prior to the European leg of the 1987 tour, Paul remained on board for the European dates. However, in the midst of touring Europe, Paul received a call from Kip, who had been working with future Winger lead guitarist Reb Beach recording more demos in New York, informing him that he had gotten a record deal. After the European tour was finished, Paul flew straight back to New York, and the Winger project (initially known as \"Sahara\") began rehearsing and recording their debut album.\n\nTaylor remained in Winger throughout the band's most successful period, which included the two smash albums, \"Winger\" and \"In the Heart of the Young\". However, after the tour supporting the latter album ended in 1991, Taylor left the band in early 1992, citing exhaustion and a desire to write and get involved with other projects. Throughout the 1990s, Taylor immersed himself in numerous other projects, perhaps the most prolific of which was recording and touring with Steve Perry for his 1994 solo album.\n\nIn 1998, he returned to the Alice Cooper band (this time, alongside fellow former Winger guitarist Reb Beach), and once that tour ended, he embarked on a brief tour with Tommy Shaw. Winger reunited in 2001 to record new material for a \"Greatest Hits\" album. Although it is unclear whether Taylor participated in these recording sessions, he did later join the band on the supporting tour. Though Paul was asked by Kip Winger to rejoin the band again to work on their 2006 reunion album, he declined because he was already involved with other projects.\n\nMore recently, Taylor has become involved in composing music for television series programs and has also been pursuing his passion for photography. He also spent the summer months of 2012 touring with Cinderella throughout the U.S. playing keyboards for them. He returned to Winger during mid-2013 and performed with them on select tour dates up through early 2014 and appeared in the Queen Babylon released in late 2014.",

In 1944 he wrote the novel Gli Anni Perduti (The Lost Years), a bold satire of Benito Mussolini's megalomania, and in 1946 Vecchio con gli Stivali (Old Man in Boots), a satirical short story inspired by the vicissitudes of Italian fascism, which won the Vendemmia Award and was adapted into a successful film, Difficult Years, by Luigi Zampa.

The first few years with the Golden Knights were rocky as Clarkson couldn't manage a winning record until the third year (and even then it was only by one win), but Clarkson won 25 games in 2006-07, including a conference championship, and when they earned a regular season crown the following season it appeared that they had turned the corner.\n\nAfter that brief success, however, Clarkson declined rapidly, ending with losing records in each of the next three seasons and causing Roll's termination at the end of the 2010-11 season. Roll quickly found a new job as he was announced as the first head coach for Nazareth College's new Division-III ice hockey program that was to begin in 2012-13. As of 2014, he is still in that position.",

He was quick to make the transition from forward to guard at UCLA. In his first season, he was the Bruins' third leading scorer (12.9 p.p.g.) and adapted smoothly to head coach John Wooden's \"attack and gamble offense\". He was a member of the UCLA teams that won national titles in the 1969 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament and the 1970 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Vallely majored in economics at UCLA and had a 3.36 grade point average as a junior.

    "evidence": "Fei-Ping Hsu (b. 1952 - d. 2001) was a renowned Chinese American pianist known for his sensitive, brilliant, and poetic interpretations. Mr. Hsu was born on the island of Gulangyu in southeast China. As the youngest son of a Christian pastor, he grew up singing hymns while his mother played on an upright piano. One day, when his mother was ill, the five-year-old Fei-Ping went to the piano and played the hymns by ear. The family realized his tremendous talent and encouraged him to study music. When he was eight years old, he had a rare opportunity to meet Professor Ji-Sen Fan, the head of the piano department of the Shanghai Conservatory, and was recognized as a child prodigy. By the time he was twelve, he already played the complete Chopin Etudes and had performed with the Shanghai Philharmonic.\n\nFeiping was invited to perform for Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, who was so impressed with his ability that she personally invited Fei-Ping to study and perform in Europe under her sponsorship. Unfortunately, he was not allowed to accept this invitation due to the advent of the Cultural Revolution during the 1960s. However, he survived the labor camps and became well known in China, touring extensively throughout the Far East as a soloist with the Central Philharmonic, the foremost leading orchestra. He was a gold medal winner at the Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Competition, the first pianist in the competition's history from the People's Republic of China. He also garnered top prizes in other international competitions, including the Gina Bachauer Memorial Piano Scholarship Competition, the University of Maryland International Competition, and the Paloma O'Shea International Competition (Spain).\n\nMr. Hsu made his New York recital debut at Alice Tully Hall in 1983 and performed throughout the United States, including notable appearances at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. He also frequently toured Europe, South America, and the Far East. Mr. Hsu was especially noted for his larger-than-life virtuosic style of Horowitzian pianism.\n\nIn 1979, Fei-Ping Hsu received permission to study in the United States. Among others, he attended the Juilliard School of Music under the tutelage of Sascha Gorodnitzki. He had given numerous concerts in Germany, France, Andorra, Switzerland, and Italy. He has appeared as a soloist with major orchestras, including the Montreal Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Maestro Charles Dutoit, the Moscow Philharmonic in Russia, the Finnish Tempere Symphony Orchestra in Europe, as well as numerous orchestras in the United States performing in various concert halls and music festivals. Mr. Hsu was also actively engaged in his native Asia, where his collaborations include appearances with the China National Symphony Orchestra in Beijing, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the Shanghai Radio Symphony Orchestra, and the Kyushu Symphony Orchestra in Japan.\n\nSince the early 1970s, Mr. Hsu had recorded for major labels such as Columbia Records, RCA Victor Records, Hugo Records, ROI Productions, and MA Recordings in Japan. Highly regarded as one of the foremost pianists of the Western and Romantic traditions, Hsu was also an early champion of the music of the modern composer Huang An-Lun. His life was cut short in a road accident while on a concert tour in China on November 27, 2001, and he is remembered by many to this day. He is survived by his wife and daughter.",

    "evidence": "Sir John Russell Reynolds, 1st Baronet (22 May 1828 – 29 May 1896) was a British neurologist and physician. Reynolds was born in Romsey, Hampshire, as the son of John Reynolds, an independent minister, and the grandson of Dr. Henry Revell Reynolds. He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851, he graduated M.B. in the University of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852, he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a Fellow of the College in 1859. In the same year, he was appointed Assistant Physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 Assistant Physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865, he became Professor of the Principles and Practice of Medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen's Household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 Vice-President of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian Lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian Oration in 1884, and was elected President in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a Baronet. In the winter of 1895–96, he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as President of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children. The \"Reynolds Baronetcy\", of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death. Reynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an \"Essay on Vertigo\"; in 1855 \"Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves\", as well as \"Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain\"; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 \"Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity\"; in 1872 \"The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity\"; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the \"System of Medicine\", in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write – compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a \"Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe\". Reynolds was a tall man, with dark hair, with a dignified delivery and some oratorical power. Reynolds died in London.",

Based on the Kollam model, the Government of India launched the National Building Centre Movement to replicate Nirmithi Kendras (building centres) in every district of the country. The Nirmithi Movement was adjudged by the United Nations as one of the global best practices in the field of sustainable human settlement development.\n\nEarly in his career, Dr. Bose introduced the \"Gramotsava\" programme in Kerala, wherein the local people were encouraged to actively participate in the village development planning. The initiative, launched in the Kasargode district of Kerala in the 1980s, was subsequently implemented in 200 panchayats across the state. Dr. Bose also founded the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in the Kollam district during his tenure as Collector. The Council generated high tourism interest in the region and created new job opportunities for the local people. The Government of Kerala subsequently set up similar councils in all 14 districts of the state. DTPs have made perceptible contributions in positioning Kerala as \"God's own country\".\n\nHe later pioneered an eco-village programme in the Mannanan village of the Kottayam district of Kerala, wherein the family clusters were encouraged to pursue activities such as organic farming, soil and water conservation through traditional methods, floriculture, horticulture, vermiculture, generation of energy from non-conventional sources, homestead forestry, etc., with institutional support, governmental assistance, and financial support from different agencies.\n\nAs Chairman of the Atomic Energy Education Society, Mumbai, Dr. Bose introduced and reinforced the concept of alternative education, wherein people could pursue studies in disciplines in which they did not have prior academic backgrounds. He founded the Institute of Alternative Education. He also launched the ASTER Project (Application of Science & Technology in Educational Reforms) which sought to alter the mode of academic delivery through the application of information and communication technology (ICT).\n\nAs Managing Director of NAFED, Dr. Bose initiated a few innovative programmes which helped control the price spiral during 2009-10. Christened as \"Farm Gate to Home Gate\", this innovation sought to buy agricultural produce directly from the farmers for distribution among the consumers, taking only marginal profit. Spurred by the success of this pilot programme in New Delhi, the Easy Market Scheme was envisaged for price control in the rest of the country.\n\nAs the administrator of the National Museum, Dr. Bose launched a 100-day programme which spelt out specific measures to revamp and revitalise the institution. Most of the improvements suggested were achieved in 60 days, such as opening the closed-down galleries, modernising the display and lighting, launching outreach programmes to take the museum to the community, arranging children's programmes to ignite young minds to the greatness of India's national heritage, organising international exhibitions, and launching the People's Museum Movement, to mention a few.\n\nPursuit of excellence was always central to Dr. Bose's role in public administration. His contributions were seldom circumscribed by the call of duty. Instead, he has been engaged in continuous research and field experimentation in developing the most appropriate, people-first solutions. He also took key steps to synergise the various government programmes and schemes to create comprehensive, sustainable, and inclusive administrative mechanisms that have since been replicated in multiple domains.\n\nIn recognition of this remarkable turnaround of the museum management and the perceptible makeover of the institution, the Government of India asked Dr. Bose to continue with this mission even after his retirement from service.",

Ifargan provides blessings and business advice to some of Israel's most prominent businessmen and politicians for a fee, and adherents believe he has the ability to diagnose patients by eyesight only. Others claim he is a charlatan who has grown into a multimillionaire from selling amulets and from other illicit businesses. He is one of the wealthiest rabbis in Israel, with an estimated net worth of $23 million as of 2012. One of the foremost followers of the rabbi is Nochi Dankner, a leading Israeli businessman, who has donated hundreds of thousands of Israeli shekels to the rabbi's causes. A 2001 report by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth claimed that most of the sums donated are not made known to the Israeli tax authorities, although this is denied by Ifargan.",

He would not pitch a Major League game with the Cubs before his contract was sold to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. Ridzik signed with the Washington Senators three years later in 1961 after developing a knuckleball. He would appear in 132 games, mostly in relief, over the next three years for the Senators. On April 13, 1964, his contract was sold back to his original team, the Phillies. He would appear in two games with the Phillies that year before calling it a career. After life as a baseball player, Ridzik worked in the Washington D.C. area for a military food distributor until moving to Florida in the late 1980s. In Florida, he helped with the organizing of charity events featuring former Major League players. He also helped establish the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association with former Senators teammate, Chuck Hinton. He died on January 8, 2008, after fighting heart disease for several years.",

    "evidence": "Twila Shively (March 20, 1920 – November 25, 1999) was an American competitive baseball player. An outfielder, she played from 1945 through 1950 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5'2\", 128 lb., she batted and threw right-handed. Shively spent five of her six years in the AAGPBL playing in the left field. A solid defensive player, she showed speed, good hands, an accurate throwing arm, and lived in a constant state of readiness. Routinely, she ranked among the top defensive outfielders in several categories, until a severe ankle injury limited her ability to perform, and she had to switch to first base. Offensively, she made consistent contact, knew when to take the extra base, and excelled as a basestealer.\n\nBorn in Decatur, Illinois, Twila Shively was the daughter of Glenn and Eva (née Bryant) Shively. She began playing softball at age eight and moved up in the softball ranks in Chicago as early as 1942. By then, she was featured in an article signed by Carl Guldager and published in the Chicago Daily News with the headline: \"She's Hedy Lamarr of Softball, Twila Shively Looks Like Model, Runs Bases Like Ty Cobb. Has Baseball Savvy Plus Pretty Face\". In 1944, Shively became a member of the Rockola Chicks team of the newly formed National Girls Baseball League. The NGBL was organized in Chicago to keep the best local players from migrating to the AAGPBL, which had been stabilized in 1943. After that, both circuits competed against each other to see who could associate itself with the biggest stars.\n\nShively entered the AAGPBL in 1945 with the Grand Rapids Chicks, playing for them three years before joining the Chicago Colleens (1948) and Peoria Redwings (1948–1950). In her rookie year, she formed part of a Chicks outfield that included Thelma Eisen in the center field and Elizabeth Wicken at right field. Shively collected a .196 batting average and a .276 on-base percentage in 106 games, driving in 23 runs and scoring 42 times, while her 46 stolen bases ranked her fifth in the league. She also led all outfielders with a .968 fielding percentage and finished second for the most putouts (234) behind Fort Wayne Daisies' Penny O'Brian (236). During the regular season, she achieved a career highlight, when she belted a two-out, walk-off grand slam to give her team the victory.\n\nHer most productive season came in 1946, when she posted career numbers in average (.247), runs scored (78), hits (101), runs batted in (45), steals (45), and games played (111). Considering the year was great for many pitchers, her numbers were quite respectable. Four no-hitters were recorded by Anna Mae Hutchison (Belles), Betty Luna (Blue Sox), Carolyn Morris (Peaches), and Amy Irene Applegren (Lassies), while Connie Wisniewski (Chicks) and Dorothy Wiltse (Daisies) topped the league in earned run average with 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. As a result, more than half of the circuit's players averaged under .200. Dorothy Kamenshek (Peaches) was the only hitter to reach the .300 mark (.316).\n\nFollowing her baseball career, Shively graduated from Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and worked as a physical education teacher at Washington High School in South Bend, Indiana. She also coached the school's softball and volleyball teams to city championships, inspiring children for almost 30 years. Twila Shively died in Douglas, Michigan on Thanksgiving Day, 1999 at the age of 79, after suffering four years of Alzheimer's disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer. She is part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, unveiled in 1988, which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual personality.",

The favourite son of his father as a child, Philip was enthroned alongside Louis VI as joint king in 1129. However, the young king gave his father little joy after that, refusing to pay attention to the old king or to follow the high standards that Louis himself followed. He became disobedient, refusing to heed scoldings or warnings; Walter Map said that he \"strayed from the paths of conduct travelled by his father and, by his overweening pride and tyrannical arrogance, made himself a burden to all.\" Philip's brief period as king was ended two years after his coronation. Riding with a group of companions along the Seine, in the Parisian market section named the Greve, his running horse was tripped by a black pig which darted out of a dung heap on the quay. The horse fell forwards, and the young king was catapulted over its head. The fall \"so dreadfully fractured his limbs that he died on the day following\" without regaining consciousness. He was buried at St Denis, and succeeded as heir, and co-king, by his pious brother, Louis the Younger (now known as Louis VII).\n\nIf Philip had been little other than trouble and a problem to his family and kingdom whilst he had lived, his legacy would prove greater trouble still. Whilst he had lived, he had nurtured a dream of visiting Jerusalem and the tomb of Christ; when he died, his brother, Louis VII, vowed to go in Philip's place. This vow would provide a reason for Louis joining the disastrous Second Crusade and an excuse to abandon Antioch in favour of Jerusalem. The Crusade brought many deaths on both sides, and the abandonment of Antioch proved a strategic failure and a partial cause for the collapse of the marriage between Louis and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Because he was co-king rather than a king in his own right, he is not generally given a number in the succession of Kings of France.",

His personal name was Xiong Lü, ancestral name Mi (芈), and King Zhuang was his posthumous title. He became one of the Five Hegemons and attempted to wrest control of China from the King of Zhou. King Zhuang ascended the throne in 613 BC at a time when the kingdom of Chu was in disarray. For the first three years of his reign, Zhuang wasted time on excessive hunting and lavish partying. Several courtiers were anxious about the king, but none dared speak up as he had given orders that anyone who challenged his authority would be killed. When a particularly senior minister challenged him through a riddle, the king responded that he had been waiting for three years for someone from his court to show some nationalistic pride. The king made Sunshu Ao chancellor and began a series of reforms. Chu's agricultural output improved significantly during his reign, aided by Sunshu Ao's comprehensive dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir created in modern-day northern Anhui province. In 611 BC he annexed the state of Yong (庸国), a move which made Chu much stronger. After some overwhelming victories at the head of his army, King Zhuang attempted to take the place of King Ding of Zhou. He asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the nine tripod cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China at the time, but was rebuffed. In the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the state of Jin, another strong state at that time. Later he achieved hegemony amongst some other states. His progress from lazy regent to a hegemon of his time gave rise to the Chinese four-character idiom of \"Yī Mǐng Jīng Rén\" (一冥而惊人).",

Mr. Hsu was born on the island of Gulangyu in southeast China. As the youngest son of a Christian pastor, he grew up singing hymns while his mother played on an upright piano. One day, when his mother was ill, the five-year-old Fei-Ping went to the piano and played the hymns by ear. The family realized his tremendous talent and encouraged him to study music. When he was eight years old, he had a rare opportunity to meet Professor Ji-Sen Fan, the head of the piano department of the Shanghai Conservatory, and was recognized as a child prodigy. By the time he was twelve, he already played the complete Chopin Etudes and had performed with the Shanghai Philharmonic.\n\nFeiping was invited to perform for Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, who was so impressed with his ability that she personally invited Fei-Ping to study and perform in Europe under her sponsorship. Unfortunately, he was not allowed to accept this invitation due to the advent of the Cultural Revolution during the 1960s. However, he survived the labor camps and became well known in China, touring extensively throughout the Far East as a soloist with the Central Philharmonic, the foremost leading orchestra. He was a gold medal winner at the Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Competition, the first pianist in the competition's history from the People's Republic of China. He also garnered top prizes in other international competitions, including the Gina Bachauer Memorial Piano Scholarship Competition, the University of Maryland International Competition, and the Paloma O'Shea International Competition (Spain).\n\nMr. Hsu made his New York recital debut at Alice Tully Hall in 1983 and performed throughout the United States, including notable appearances at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. He also frequently toured Europe, South America, and the Far East. Mr. Hsu was especially noted for his larger-than-life virtuosic style of Horowitzian pianism.\n\nIn 1979, Fei-Ping Hsu received permission to study in the United States. Among others, he attended the Juilliard School of Music under the tutelage of Sascha Gorodnitzki. He had given numerous concerts in Germany, France, Andorra, Switzerland, and Italy. He has appeared as a soloist with major orchestras, including the Montreal Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Maestro Charles Dutoit, the Moscow Philharmonic in Russia, the Finnish Tempere Symphony Orchestra in Europe, as well as numerous orchestras in the United States performing in various concert halls and music festivals. Mr. Hsu was also actively engaged in his native Asia, where his collaborations include appearances with the China National Symphony Orchestra in Beijing, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the Shanghai Radio Symphony Orchestra, and the Kyushu Symphony Orchestra in Japan.\n\nSince the early 1970s, Mr. Hsu had recorded for major labels such as Columbia Records, RCA Victor Records, Hugo Records, ROI Productions, and MA Recordings in Japan. Highly regarded as one of the foremost pianists of the Western and Romantic traditions, Hsu was also an early champion of the music of the modern composer Huang An-Lun. His life was cut short in a road accident while on a concert tour in China on November 27, 2001, and he is remembered by many to this day. He is survived by his wife and daughter.",

For his actions in World War II, Foster was awarded both the Silver Star and the Légion d'Honneur. At the end of the war, Göring surrendered to the Allied Powers in the Bavarian Alps. On May 9, 1945, Foster transported Göring back to Germany on a 55-minute flight in an unescorted, unarmed L-5, a larger plane than the L4 he normally piloted, because Göring weighed more than. According to \"China Daily\", in a letter to his wife, Virginia, written at the time, Foster describes his first impression of Göring as \"effeminate gave me the creeps...several times I had the impulse to turn the plane over and see if I could shake him out, but he was wedged in like a champagne cork.\" Foster said that Göring, who spoke some English, avoided any talk of Adolf Hitler, with whom Göring – as the commander of the Luftwaffe – had fallen out of favor as the total German defeat neared. \"He acted as though he was going on a sightseeing tour, or really as though I was going on a sightseeing tour, and he was showing me where he grew up. I had a .45 in a shoulder holster, but he couldn't reach that. But neither could I, because I had two hands controlling the plane.\" Foster further recalled Göring as having been sharp, friendly, and witty, having joked when Foster asked him when Germany began manufacturing jets. \"Too late,\" Göring was said to have answered. Foster continued: \"I could see that he was like one of our officers if he'd been picked up. I questioned all that we knew about these vicious people.\" Göring was convicted of war crimes and committed suicide in October 1946 by taking a cyanide capsule before he could be hanged by the Nuremberg authorities.\n\nBy October 1945, Foster was back in the United States, having flown seventy reconnaissance combat missions during his wartime service. He returned to his adopted home state of Montana, where he was appointed Lieutenant Colonel in the Montana Army National Guard. He was thereafter promoted to Brigadier General, a rank that he held from 1963 until 1971. A native of Richmond, Virginia, Foster graduated in 1937 with a degree in English from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. He and his wife, Virginia Lou Foster (February 15, 1916 – May 7, 1993) were married in 1940. The couple had one daughter, Susan Carol Foster Korkalo (1944 – 2007). Foster received the Silver Star for his wartime service in Southern France in 1944. It was not until 2009 that he received the French Legion of Honor, when Pierre Vimont, the French Ambassador to the United States, released a letter hailing Foster for his \"personal, precious contribution to the United States' decisive role in the liberation of our country during World War II.\" Foster died at the age of ninety-nine in a nursing home in Missoula, Montana. His last city of residence was Livingston in Park County, Montana. Survivors included son-in-law Roy E. Korkalo of Livingston, grandson Chris Korkalo, and a sister, Priscilla F. Howell.",

Loder (7 April 1946 – 12 August 2005) was an English sound engineer, record producer, and founder of Southern Studios, as well as a former member of Exit and co-founder of the Southern Records distribution company with his wife Sue. He was also the studio engineer of choice for Crass Records and was often considered to be the band's \"ninth member\". Loder was born near Plymouth and educated at boarding school before studying electrical engineering at London's City University. During his post-graduate work there, he became involved in early experiments in digital encoding of audio for the military. By 1970, he had joined Exit, alongside Penny Rimbaud, utilizing a one-track tape-recorder. This led to Loder eventually founding a record studio in his garage after the disbanding of Exit in 1974.\n\nLoder was recording advertising jingles in 1977 when his path crossed once again with Rimbaud, who had by then co-founded Crass, and at this point invited Loder to become the band's engineer and financial manager, roles Loder happily accepted. When Crass founded their own record label, Loder worked as an engineer on most of the label's releases, and when Loder saw potential in a number of bands turned away by Crass Records due to ideological differences, he set up Southern Records. Loder engineered and produced for many bands other than Crass, among them The Jesus and Mary Chain, for whom he engineered the recordings of the \"Psychocandy\" album, Big Black's \"Songs About Fucking\", PJ Harvey, Babes in Toyland, Fugazi, Ministry, and Shellac.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Loder established a television production facility at Southern. Its notable output included the music show \"Snub TV\", which after first being syndicated nationwide in the USA, went on to further success on BBC2 and in other countries. Loder was responsible for encouraging and establishing independent alternative internet ezines, donating the use of Southern's servers and bandwidth, taking part in pioneering online media streaming and simulcasting. Loder died of a brain tumour in 2005, aged 59.",

He founded Mason Science College in 1875, which later became the University of Birmingham. He was the son of a carpet-weaver and was born in Mill Street, Kidderminster. He began life as a street hawker of cakes, fruits, and vegetables. After trying his hand in his native town at shoemaking, baking, carpentry, blacksmithing, house-painting, and carpet-weaving, he moved in 1816 to Birmingham. There he found employment in the gilt-toy trade. In 1824, he set up on his own account as a manufacturer of split-rings by machinery, to which he subsequently added the making of steel pens. Owing to the circumstance of his pens being supplied through James Perry, the London stationer whose name they bore, he was less well known than Joseph Gillott and other makers, although he was really the largest producer in England, contributing heavily to the Birmingham pen trade. In 1874, the business was converted into a limited liability company. Besides his steel-pen trade, Mason carried on for many years the business of electro-plating, copper-smelting, and India-rubber ring making, in conjunction with George Elkington. Mason was almost entirely self-educated, having taught himself to write when a shoemaker's apprentice, and in later life he felt his deficiencies keenly. It was this which led him in 1860 to establish his great orphanage at Erdington, near Birmingham. Upon it he expended about £300,000, and for this munificent endowment he was knighted in 1872. He had previously given a dispensary to his native town and an almshouse to Erdington. In 1880, Mason College, since incorporated in the University of Birmingham, was opened. The total value of the endowment was about £250,000.",

He played for the Buffalo Bisons, Detroit Wolverines, Kansas City Cowboys, Baltimore Orioles, and Cincinnati Red Stockings (AA). At the start of the 1882 season, clubs playing in the American Association had their players wear non-matching silk uniforms, with a different color and/or pattern corresponding to each position in the field. Accordingly, on opening day for the Red Stockings, Stearns wore an unusual candy-striped jersey. On September 11, 1882, Stearns was involved in a notable milestone, when pitcher Tony Mullane of the Louisville Eclipse pitched the first no-hit game in the history of the American Association against Stearns and his teammates on the Cincinnati Red Stockings, a 2-0 win by Louisville. Stearns made the game's final out by bouncing into a fielder's choice that forced runner Pop Snyder at second base. The Red Stockings had the last laugh, however, ending the year as the AA's inaugural champions. Unsatisfied with their first-base play in 1882, the Red Stockings signed Long John Reilly of the New York Metropolitans to replace Stearns prior to the 1883 season. Stearns spent the 1887 season with the Topeka Golden Giants of the Western League, leading that league in hits. That team finished with a dominant record of 90-25, and is sometimes described as the strongest minor league baseball club of the 19th century.

During this time, the two began composing songs together and, while on break from touring, recorded what would become the first Winger demos. Whereas Kip left Alice's band prior to the European leg of the 1987 tour, Paul remained on board for the European dates. However, in the midst of touring Europe, Paul received a call from Kip, who had been working with future Winger lead guitarist Reb Beach recording more demos in New York, informing him that he had gotten a record deal. After the European tour was finished, Paul flew straight back to New York, and the Winger project (initially known as \"Sahara\") began rehearsing and recording their debut album.\n\nTaylor remained in Winger throughout the band's most successful period, which included the two smash albums, \"Winger\" and \"In the Heart of the Young\". However, after the tour supporting the latter album ended in 1991, Taylor left the band in early 1992, citing exhaustion and a desire to write and get involved with other projects. Throughout the 1990s, Taylor immersed himself in numerous other projects, perhaps the most prolific of which was recording and touring with Steve Perry for his 1994 solo album.\n\nIn 1998, he returned to the Alice Cooper band (this time, alongside fellow former Winger guitarist Reb Beach), and once that tour ended, he embarked on a brief tour with Tommy Shaw. Winger reunited in 2001 to record new material for a \"Greatest Hits\" album. Although it is unclear whether Taylor participated in these recording sessions, he did later join the band on the supporting tour. Though Paul was asked by Kip Winger to rejoin the band again to work on their 2006 reunion album, he declined because he was already involved with other projects.\n\nMore recently, Taylor has become involved in composing music for television series programs and has also been pursuing his passion for photography. He also spent the summer months of 2012 touring with Cinderella throughout the U.S. playing keyboards for them. He returned to Winger during mid-2013 and performed with them on select tour dates up through early 2014 and appeared in the Queen Babylon released in late 2014.",

Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. As a child, Pierce did well academically, graduating from high school in 1952. He received a baccalaureate in physics from Rice University in 1955, earned a doctorate from University of Colorado at Boulder in 1962, and became an assistant professor of physics at the Oregon State University in 1962, where he joined the anti-communist John Birch Society.\n\nIn 1965, in order to finance his political ambitions, he left his tenure at Oregon State University and became a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney in New Haven, Connecticut.

Pierce intended the National Alliance to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist revolution in the United States.\n\nIn 1978, Pierce wrote, under the pseudonym \"Andrew Macdonald\", the novel The Turner Diaries, which depicts a violent revolution in the United States which leads to the overthrow of the United States federal government.

Pierce spent the rest of his life in West Virginia hosting a weekly radio show, \"American Dissident Voices\", publishing the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and overseeing his publications, National Vanguard Magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. and music produced by his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce suddenly died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members and a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline. His works, however, continue to enjoy a notable audience.",

    "evidence": "Hephaestion (c. 356 BC – 324 BC), son of Amyntor, was a Macedonian nobleman and a general in the army of Alexander the Great. He was \"...by far the dearest of all the king's friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets.\" This friendship lasted throughout their lives, and was compared, by others as well as themselves, to that of Achilles and Patroclus. His military career was distinguished. A member of Alexander the Great's personal bodyguard, he went on to command the Companion Cavalry and was entrusted with many other tasks throughout Alexander's ten-year campaign in Asia, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges, and the foundation of new settlements. Besides being a soldier, engineer, and diplomat, he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate the Greeks and Persians. Alexander formally made him his second-in-command when he appointed him Chiliarch of the Empire. Alexander also made him part of the royal family when he gave him as his bride Drypetis, sister to his own second wife Stateira, both daughters of Darius III of Persia. When he died suddenly at Ecbatana around age thirty-two, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief. He petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant Hephaestion divine status, and thus Hephaestion was honored as a \"divine hero\". Hephaestion was cremated in Babylon in the presence of the entire army. At the time of his own death a mere eight months later, Alexander was still planning lasting monuments to Hephaestion's memory.",

    "evidence": "Professor Kattungal Subramaniam Manilal (born 17 September 1938) is an Emeritus of the University of Calicut, a botany scholar and taxonomist, who devoted over 35 years of his life to research, translation, and annotation work of the Latin botanical treatise Hortus Malabaricus. This epic effort brought to light the main contents of the book, a wealth of botanical information on Malabar that had largely remained inaccessible to English-speaking scholars, because the entire text was in the Latin language. Despite the existence of Hendrik van Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus over the last three centuries, the correct taxonomic identity of many plants listed in Hortus Malabaricus, their medicinal properties, methods of use, etc., as described and codified by renowned traditional medical authorities of 17th century India remained inaccessible to English language-based scholars, until Manilal commenced publication of research papers and books on Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal's efforts ultimately resulted in an English edition of Hortus Malabaricus, for the first time, 325 years after its original publication from Amsterdam. The English edition contains a word-by-word translation of all the twelve volumes of the book, retaining the original style of language. Medicinal properties of plants are translated and interpreted, with commentaries on their Malayalam names given by van Rheede. In addition, the correct scientific identity of all plants, acceptable under ICBN, are set out along with their important synonyms and basionyms. Whilst the scope of Manilal's contributions to botany extend far beyond the research and publications around Hortus Malabaricus, his research work on Hortus Malabaricus alone are of botanical and socio-historic significance, and can be broadly classified under two heads: botanical and medicinal aspects of Hortus Malabaricus; and historical, political, social, and linguistic aspects of Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal has over 198 published research papers and 15 books to his credit as author and co-author. He and his associates have credits to discovering over 14 species of flowering plants, varieties, and combinations new to science. Manilal is the founder president of the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT).",

    "evidence": "George John Kurowski (April 19, 1918 – December 9, 1999) was a third baseman in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the St. Louis Cardinals (1949). Kurowski batted and threw right-handed. He debuted on September 23, 1941, and played his final game on October 1, 1949. In a nine-season career, Kurowski posted a .286 batting average with 106 home runs and 529 RBI in 916 games played. Kurowski's childhood nickname came from his already white hair. A native of Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski overcame several personal problems. He overcame childhood osteomyelitis, which made him miss a part of a bone on his right forearm. Before he started his baseball career, his older brother died in a mine accident, and his father died from a heart attack during spring training in 1942. His most productive season came in 1945, when he posted career-highs in average (.310), home runs (27), RBI (104), runs (108), doubles (27), slugging percentage (.544) and on-base percentage (.420). An All-Star during five consecutive seasons (1943–47), Kurowski exceeded the 20 home run mark three times to set a major league record for a third baseman (1944–45, 1947), and hit over .300 three times (1945–47). He also led the National League three times in putouts, twice in fielding percentage, and once in double plays. In four World Series appearances, Kurowski hit .253 (21-for-83) with one home run and nine RBI in 23 games, as the Cardinals were world champions in 1942, 1944 and 1946. His only home run in the series, in 1942, off Red Ruffing, broke a 2–2 tie in the ninth inning of Game Five to clinch the title for St. Louis over the New York Yankees. He also appeared five times in the MVP ballot, in 1942 and from 1944 through 1947. In 1949, Kurowski developed arm and elbow problems and his playing career ended. After that, he coached and managed in the minor leagues for 18 years until 1972. He gained induction into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame in 1988. In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \"All-Time All-Star Argument Starter,\" consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Kurowski was the third baseman on Stein's Polish team. Kurowski died in Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania, at age 81.",

Dane recommended Meagher, but cautioned, \"He's kind of weird.

In addition to providing backing vocals, Meagher sang lead on occasion, as on \"They'll Make You Cry,\" a song from the band's 1965 debut album, Introducing the Beau Brummels. Meagher appeared with the band in the 1965 science-fiction/comedy movie Village of the Giants, which was featured in a 1994 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. He remained with the band as it reduced from a quintet to a trio by 1967's critically acclaimed album Triangle. During the recording of the band's next album, 1968's Bradley's Barn, Meagher was drafted, becoming one of the few musicians from a well-known rock band to serve in the military at the height of the Vietnam War. After he was discharged two years later, Meagher played in the Black Velvet Band with former Beau Brummels bandmate Declan Mulligan. Over the next three decades, Meagher has also participated in several Beau Brummels revivals, most notably in the mid-1970s when the band released a 1975 self-titled reunion album.",

Born in Barmouth, Merioneth to Christopher Nutter and Dorothy (formerly Banister), he was raised in Edgware, Middlesex, where his father owned a local high street café. After the family moved to Kilburn, Nutter and his brother David attended Willesden Technical College. Nutter initially studied plumbing and then architecture, but he abandoned both aged 19 to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy. In the early 1960s, he joined traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward. After seven years, in 1969, he joined up with Edward Sexton to open \"Nutters of Savile Row\" at No. 35a Savile Row. They were financially backed by Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, managing director of the Beatles' Apple Corps Peter Brown, and lawyer James Vallance-White. The business was an immediate success, as Nutter combined traditional tailoring skills with innovative design. He designed for the Hardy Amies range, and then for the man himself. His clients included his investors, plus Sir Roy Strong, Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger and Elton John. Nutter himself was most proud of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles' album \"Abbey Road\" in 1969, he dressed three out of the four: George Harrison elected to be photographed on the road-crossing in denims.\n\nIn the 1970s, his bespoke business became less successful, but he branched out into ready-to-wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing the Savile Row brand in Japan. In 1976, Sexton bought Nutter out of the business. Nutter went to work for Kilgour French and Stanbury, managing his own workroom. Sexton continued to run Nutters of Savile Row until 1983, when Nutter returned to the Row with a ready-to-wear shop: \"Tommy Nutter, Savile Row\". (This new venture, which traded at No. 19 Savile Row until Tommy's death, was backed by J&J Crombie Limited, who continue to own the \"Tommy Nutter\" trademark.) At this time, Sexton set up a business in his own name. In the 1980s, he described his suits as a \"cross between the big-shouldered 'Miami Vice' look and the authentic Savile Row.\" He created the clothing of the Joker worn by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film \"Batman\". Nutter died in 1992 at the Cromwell Hospital in London of complications from AIDS.",

Although he is perhaps most frequently associated with Winger, Taylor has also played with numerous other prominent musicians, including future Sammy Hagar and Boston guitarist Gary Pihl (in his early days), Eric Martin (solo artist and future Mr. Big frontman), Aldo Nova, Steve Perry of Journey, Alice Cooper, and Tommy Shaw.\n\nTaylor experienced his first mainstream success in the early 1980s as the touring keyboardist in Canadian musician Aldo Nova's backing band, and he appears in the music video for Nova's biggest hit, \"Fantasy.\" Prior to forming Winger, Taylor and Kip Winger were both playing with Alice Cooper's backing band on the tours for Cooper's mid-80s albums, \"Constrictor\" (1986) and \"Raise Your Fist and Yell\" (1987). During this time, the two began composing songs together and, while on break from touring, recorded what would become the first Winger demos. Whereas Kip left Alice's band prior to the European leg of the 1987 tour, Paul remained on board for the European dates. However, in the midst of touring Europe, Paul received a call from Kip, who had been working with future Winger lead guitarist Reb Beach recording more demos in New York, informing him that he had gotten a record deal. After the European tour was finished, Paul flew straight back to New York, and the Winger project (initially known as \"Sahara\") began rehearsing and recording their debut album.\n\nTaylor remained in Winger throughout the band's most successful period, which included the two smash albums, \"Winger\" and \"In the Heart of the Young\". However, after the tour supporting the latter album ended in 1991, Taylor left the band in early 1992, citing exhaustion and a desire to write and get involved with other projects. Throughout the 1990s, Taylor immersed himself in numerous other projects, perhaps the most prolific of which was recording and touring with Steve Perry for his 1994 solo album.\n\nIn 1998, he returned to the Alice Cooper band (this time, alongside fellow former Winger guitarist Reb Beach), and once that tour ended, he embarked on a brief tour with Tommy Shaw. Winger reunited in 2001 to record new material for a \"Greatest Hits\" album. Although it is unclear whether Taylor participated in these recording sessions, he did later join the band on the supporting tour. Though Paul was asked by Kip Winger to rejoin the band again to work on their 2006 reunion album, he declined because he was already involved with other projects.\n\nMore recently, Taylor has become involved in composing music for television series programs and has also been pursuing his passion for photography. He also spent the summer months of 2012 touring with Cinderella throughout the U.S. playing keyboards for them. He returned to Winger during mid-2013 and performed with them on select tour dates up through early 2014 and appeared in the Queen Babylon released in late 2014.",

Loder (7 April 1946 – 12 August 2005) was an English sound engineer, record producer, and founder of Southern Studios, as well as a former member of Exit and co-founder of the Southern Records distribution company with his wife Sue. He was also the studio engineer of choice for Crass Records and was often considered to be the band's \"ninth member\". Loder was born near Plymouth and educated at boarding school before studying electrical engineering at London's City University. During his post-graduate work there, he became involved in early experiments in digital encoding of audio for the military. By 1970, he had joined Exit, alongside Penny Rimbaud, utilizing a one-track tape-recorder. This led to Loder eventually founding a record studio in his garage after the disbanding of Exit in 1974.\n\nLoder was recording advertising jingles in 1977 when his path crossed once again with Rimbaud, who had by then co-founded Crass, and at this point invited Loder to become the band's engineer and financial manager, roles Loder happily accepted. When Crass founded their own record label, Loder worked as an engineer on most of the label's releases, and when Loder saw potential in a number of bands turned away by Crass Records due to ideological differences, he set up Southern Records. Loder engineered and produced for many bands other than Crass, among them The Jesus and Mary Chain, for whom he engineered the recordings of the \"Psychocandy\" album, Big Black's \"Songs About Fucking\", PJ Harvey, Babes in Toyland, Fugazi, Ministry, and Shellac.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Loder established a television production facility at Southern. Its notable output included the music show \"Snub TV\", which after first being syndicated nationwide in the USA, went on to further success on BBC2 and in other countries. Loder was responsible for encouraging and establishing independent alternative internet ezines, donating the use of Southern's servers and bandwidth, taking part in pioneering online media streaming and simulcasting. Loder died of a brain tumour in 2005, aged 59.",

Biagi started his career in single seaters, driving in the Formula Alfa Boxer and Italian Formula Three Championship, where he was the fifth best in 1995, with two wins. From there, he moved up to the FIA Formula 3000 Championship from 1995 to 1998, without major results.

    "evidence": "Tommy Nutter (17 April 1943 – 17 August 1992) was a British tailor, famous for reinventing the Savile Row suit in the 1960s. Born in Barmouth, Merioneth to Christopher Nutter and Dorothy (formerly Banister), he was raised in Edgware, Middlesex, where his father owned a local high street café. After the family moved to Kilburn, Nutter and his brother David attended Willesden Technical College. Nutter initially studied plumbing and then architecture, but he abandoned both aged 19 to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy. In the early 1960s, he joined traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward. After seven years, in 1969, he joined up with Edward Sexton to open \"Nutters of Savile Row\" at No. 35a Savile Row. They were financially backed by Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, managing director of the Beatles' Apple Corps Peter Brown, and lawyer James Vallance-White. The business was an immediate success, as Nutter combined traditional tailoring skills with innovative design. He designed for the Hardy Amies range, and then for the man himself. His clients included his investors, plus Sir Roy Strong, Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger and Elton John. Nutter himself was most proud of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles' album \"Abbey Road\" in 1969, he dressed three out of the four: George Harrison elected to be photographed on the road-crossing in denims.\n\nIn the 1970s, his bespoke business became less successful, but he branched out into ready-to-wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing the Savile Row brand in Japan. In 1976, Sexton bought Nutter out of the business. Nutter went to work for Kilgour French and Stanbury, managing his own workroom. Sexton continued to run Nutters of Savile Row until 1983, when Nutter returned to the Row with a ready-to-wear shop: \"Tommy Nutter, Savile Row\". (This new venture, which traded at No. 19 Savile Row until Tommy's death, was backed by J&J Crombie Limited, who continue to own the \"Tommy Nutter\" trademark.) At this time, Sexton set up a business in his own name. In the 1980s, he described his suits as a \"cross between the big-shouldered 'Miami Vice' look and the authentic Savile Row.\" He created the clothing of the Joker worn by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film \"Batman\". Nutter died in 1992 at the Cromwell Hospital in London of complications from AIDS.",

    "evidence": "Ayn Rand (born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum; March 6, 1982) was a Russian-born American novelist, philosopher, playwright, and screenwriter. She is known for her two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and for developing a philosophical system she called Objectivism. Born and educated in Russia, Rand moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935–1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful in America, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead. In 1957, she published her best-known work, the novel Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982.\n\nRand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism, and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, instead supporting \"laissez-faire\" capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for some Aristotelians and classical liberals. Literary critics received Rand's fiction with mixed reviews, and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings. She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.",

In club football, he played 635 league games, scoring a total of 138 goals, playing 21 of 25 career seasons in either the English or Scottish top-flight. In international football, Strachan earned 50 caps, scoring five goals and playing in two FIFA World Cup final tournaments, Spain 82 and Mexico 86. Strachan retired from playing in 1997 at age 40, setting a Premier League record for an outfield player.\n\nA right-sided midfielder, Strachan made his senior debut in 1974 with Dundee before moving on within Scotland, to spend seven seasons at Aberdeen. He first played for the Scotland national team in 1980. While at Aberdeen, Strachan won multiple domestic league and cup honours in the early 1980s, as well as the 1982–83 European Cup Winners' Cup and 1983 European Super Cup. Moving to England, Strachan won the 1985 FA Cup Final in five seasons with Manchester United, before spending the next seven seasons as club captain at Leeds, winning the 1989–90 Second Division and 1991–92 First Division league titles. He played his last game for Scotland in 1992 while still at Leeds, and then moved to Coventry in 1995 for a final three seasons, as a player-coach. Strachan became full-time manager of Coventry when the incumbent Ron Atkinson was appointed as director of football.\n\nAfter five years in the job he was sacked in 2001, when Coventry were relegated from the top-flight for the first time in 34 years. However, he immediately returned to the Premier League with Southampton and guided the \"Saints\" to the 2003 FA Cup Final – where they lost 1–0 to Arsenal. Strachan resigned from Southampton in 2004 and took a 16-month break from management before returning to Scotland to become manager of Celtic in the Scottish Premier League. With Celtic he achieved three successive league titles and other domestic cup wins, before resigning in May 2009 after failing to win a fourth title.

For his actions in World War II, Foster was awarded both the Silver Star and the Légion d'Honneur. At the end of the war, Göring surrendered to the Allied Powers in the Bavarian Alps. On May 9, 1945, Foster transported Göring back to Germany on a 55-minute flight in an unescorted, unarmed L-5, a larger plane than the L4 he normally piloted, because Göring weighed more than. According to \"China Daily\", in a letter to his wife, Virginia, written at the time, Foster describes his first impression of Göring as \"effeminate gave me the creeps...several times I had the impulse to turn the plane over and see if I could shake him out, but he was wedged in like a champagne cork.\" Foster said that Göring, who spoke some English, avoided any talk of Adolf Hitler, with whom Göring – as the commander of the Luftwaffe – had fallen out of favor as the total German defeat neared. \"He acted as though he was going on a sightseeing tour, or really as though I was going on a sightseeing tour, and he was showing me where he grew up. I had a .45 in a shoulder holster, but he couldn't reach that. But neither could I, because I had two hands controlling the plane.\" Foster further recalled Göring as having been sharp, friendly, and witty, having joked when Foster asked him when Germany began manufacturing jets. \"Too late,\" Göring was said to have answered. Foster continued: \"I could see that he was like one of our officers if he'd been picked up. I questioned all that we knew about these vicious people.\" Göring was convicted of war crimes and committed suicide in October 1946 by taking a cyanide capsule before he could be hanged by the Nuremberg authorities.\n\nBy October 1945, Foster was back in the United States, having flown seventy reconnaissance combat missions during his wartime service. He returned to his adopted home state of Montana, where he was appointed Lieutenant Colonel in the Montana Army National Guard. He was thereafter promoted to Brigadier General, a rank that he held from 1963 until 1971. A native of Richmond, Virginia, Foster graduated in 1937 with a degree in English from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. He and his wife, Virginia Lou Foster (February 15, 1916 – May 7, 1993) were married in 1940. The couple had one daughter, Susan Carol Foster Korkalo (1944 – 2007). Foster received the Silver Star for his wartime service in Southern France in 1944. It was not until 2009 that he received the French Legion of Honor, when Pierre Vimont, the French Ambassador to the United States, released a letter hailing Foster for his \"personal, precious contribution to the United States' decisive role in the liberation of our country during World War II.\" Foster died at the age of ninety-nine in a nursing home in Missoula, Montana. His last city of residence was Livingston in Park County, Montana. Survivors included son-in-law Roy E. Korkalo of Livingston, grandson Chris Korkalo, and a sister, Priscilla F. Howell.",

During his post-graduate work there, he became involved in early experiments in digital encoding of audio for the military.

Syed was the principle media spokesperson and had control of the media representative services in the country during his stay as Minister.\n\nSyed was again arrested in 1999 by General Pervez Musharraf who successfully staged a 1999 coup d'état against the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Syed was subsequently released in 2000 and later defected to a splinter group of the Pakistan Muslim League, and was appointed as General-Secretary of the splinter group. In 2008, he secured the nomination for the office of President of Pakistan but conceded his defeat in favour of Asif Ali Zardari.",

    "evidence": "Philip (29 August 1116 – 13 October 1131) was the King of France from 1129, co-ruling with his father, Louis VI. His mother was Louis VI's second wife, Adelaide of Maurienne. The favourite son of his father as a child, Philip was enthroned alongside Louis VI as joint king in 1129. However, the young king gave his father little joy after that, refusing to pay attention to the old king or to follow the high standards that Louis himself followed. He became disobedient, refusing to heed scoldings or warnings; Walter Map said that he \"strayed from the paths of conduct travelled by his father and, by his overweening pride and tyrannical arrogance, made himself a burden to all.\" Philip's brief period as king was ended two years after his coronation. Riding with a group of companions along the Seine, in the Parisian market section named the Greve, his running horse was tripped by a black pig which darted out of a dung heap on the quay. The horse fell forwards, and the young king was catapulted over its head. The fall \"so dreadfully fractured his limbs that he died on the day following\" without regaining consciousness. He was buried at St Denis, and succeeded as heir, and co-king, by his pious brother, Louis the Younger (now known as Louis VII).\n\nIf Philip had been little other than trouble and a problem to his family and kingdom whilst he had lived, his legacy would prove greater trouble still. Whilst he had lived, he had nurtured a dream of visiting Jerusalem and the tomb of Christ; when he died, his brother, Louis VII, vowed to go in Philip's place. This vow would provide a reason for Louis joining the disastrous Second Crusade and an excuse to abandon Antioch in favour of Jerusalem. The Crusade brought many deaths on both sides, and the abandonment of Antioch proved a strategic failure and a partial cause for the collapse of the marriage between Louis and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Because he was co-king rather than a king in his own right, he is not generally given a number in the succession of Kings of France.",

They went into the studio in December 1995 with a few friends and released a five-song demo. The next year saw the release of their first EP, and many shows throughout Central Massachusetts. In early 1997, Bane released the \"Free to Think, Free to Be\" EP, and in 1998 the band released the \"Holding This Moment\" 7\" and CD collection, and embarked upon their first US tour. Like many other hardcore bands, Bane are known for their promotion of tolerance and unity within the scene. In 2014, Bane released their final album, \"Don't Wait Up\", though the band has said they still plan to tour.",

    "evidence": "Philip (29 August 1116 – 13 October 1131) was the King of France from 1129, co-ruling with his father, Louis VI. His mother was Louis VI's second wife, Adelaide of Maurienne. The favourite son of his father as a child, Philip was enthroned alongside Louis VI as joint king in 1129. However, the young king gave his father little joy after that, refusing to pay attention to the old king or to follow the high standards that Louis himself followed. He became disobedient, refusing to heed scoldings or warnings; Walter Map said that he \"strayed from the paths of conduct travelled by his father and, by his overweening pride and tyrannical arrogance, made himself a burden to all.\" Philip's brief period as king was ended two years after his coronation. Riding with a group of companions along the Seine, in the Parisian market section named the Greve, his running horse was tripped by a black pig which darted out of a dung heap on the quay. The horse fell forwards, and the young king was catapulted over its head. The fall \"so dreadfully fractured his limbs that he died on the day following\" without regaining consciousness. He was buried at St Denis, and succeeded as heir, and co-king, by his pious brother, Louis the Younger (now known as Louis VII).\n\nIf Philip had been little other than trouble and a problem to his family and kingdom whilst he had lived, his legacy would prove greater trouble still. Whilst he had lived, he had nurtured a dream of visiting Jerusalem and the tomb of Christ; when he died, his brother, Louis VII, vowed to go in Philip's place. This vow would provide a reason for Louis joining the disastrous Second Crusade and an excuse to abandon Antioch in favour of Jerusalem. The Crusade brought many deaths on both sides, and the abandonment of Antioch proved a strategic failure and a partial cause for the collapse of the marriage between Louis and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Because he was co-king rather than a king in his own right, he is not generally given a number in the succession of Kings of France.",

    "evidence": "Royce Campbell is a jazz guitarist primarily associated with mainstream jazz, but he has also released smooth jazz and post-bop jazz recordings. He was born in Seymour, Indiana, in 1952. The son of a career Navy man, Campbell grew up in various cities around the U.S. and abroad, including Asia, Europe, and the West Indies. Exposure to various musical genres while a child contributed to Campbell's musical style and approach in jazz composition and playing. A love for rock and roll marked Campbell's first connection with the guitar, at the age of nine, when he discovered Chuck Berry. Like many guitarists of his generation, Campbell was also influenced by Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. By the time Royce finished high school in the early 1970s, he was certain he wanted to pursue a professional career in music. His uncle, Carroll Decamp, an arranger/pianist who arranged for Stan Kenton and Les Elgart, invited Royce to live with him and study in Indiana, providing most of Royce's musical education in theory and composition. By age 21, Campbell had begun touring with R&B artist Marvin Gaye and developing his talents for stage performance. In 1975, Royce was hired by a local music contractor to do three concerts with award-winning film composer Henry Mancini in Indianapolis. Soon after, Royce became the touring guitarist with Henry Mancini's orchestra, holding that position until Mancini's death in 1994. While appearing on recordings as a sideman, and a couple as leader, during the early years of his career, Campbell started recording and touring more on his own during the 1990s, focusing at first on mainstream or straight-ahead jazz. Although he cites Wes Montgomery as his main influence, the influence of horn players such as Dexter Gordon and Chet Baker are evident in Royce's melodic style. In 1993, he produced Project G-5: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery, which also featured guitarists Tal Farlow, Jimmy Raney, Herb Ellis, and Cal Collins. His 1994 album 6x6 featured guitarists Pat Martino, John Abercrombie, Larry Coryell, Dave Stryker, and Bucky Pizzarelli. With Project G-5: A Tribute to Joe Pass, in 1999, he combined the talents of Charlie Byrd, Gene Bertoncini, Mundell Lowe, and John Pisano. During his career, Royce Campbell has released more than 30 CDs as leader or co-leader, among various sideman projects. Fifteen of these CDs have made it onto the US National Jazz Radio Charts. Campbell's soloing is documented among other jazz guitarists of the era, in Mel Bay's Anthology of Jazz Guitar Solos: Featuring Solos by the World's Finest Jazz Guitarists! In November 2010, Royce Campbell was inducted into the Indianapolis Jazz Foundation Hall of Fame.",

His military career was distinguished. A member of Alexander the Great's personal bodyguard, he went on to command the Companion Cavalry and was entrusted with many other tasks throughout Alexander's ten-year campaign in Asia, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges, and the foundation of new settlements. Besides being a soldier, engineer, and diplomat, he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate the Greeks and Persians. Alexander formally made him his second-in-command when he appointed him Chiliarch of the Empire. Alexander also made him part of the royal family when he gave him as his bride Drypetis, sister to his own second wife Stateira, both daughters of Darius III of Persia. When he died suddenly at Ecbatana around age thirty-two, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief. He petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant Hephaestion divine status, and thus Hephaestion was honored as a \"divine hero\". Hephaestion was cremated in Babylon in the presence of the entire army. At the time of his own death a mere eight months later, Alexander was still planning lasting monuments to Hephaestion's memory.",

The favourite son of his father as a child, Philip was enthroned alongside Louis VI as joint king in 1129. However, the young king gave his father little joy after that, refusing to pay attention to the old king or to follow the high standards that Louis himself followed. He became disobedient, refusing to heed scoldings or warnings; Walter Map said that he \"strayed from the paths of conduct travelled by his father and, by his overweening pride and tyrannical arrogance, made himself a burden to all.\" Philip's brief period as king was ended two years after his coronation. Riding with a group of companions along the Seine, in the Parisian market section named the Greve, his running horse was tripped by a black pig which darted out of a dung heap on the quay. The horse fell forwards, and the young king was catapulted over its head. The fall \"so dreadfully fractured his limbs that he died on the day following\" without regaining consciousness. He was buried at St Denis, and succeeded as heir, and co-king, by his pious brother, Louis the Younger (now known as Louis VII).\n\nIf Philip had been little other than trouble and a problem to his family and kingdom whilst he had lived, his legacy would prove greater trouble still. Whilst he had lived, he had nurtured a dream of visiting Jerusalem and the tomb of Christ; when he died, his brother, Louis VII, vowed to go in Philip's place. This vow would provide a reason for Louis joining the disastrous Second Crusade and an excuse to abandon Antioch in favour of Jerusalem. The Crusade brought many deaths on both sides, and the abandonment of Antioch proved a strategic failure and a partial cause for the collapse of the marriage between Louis and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Because he was co-king rather than a king in his own right, he is not generally given a number in the succession of Kings of France.",

    "evidence": "Adamu ɓii Ardo Hassana (c. 1771 – c. 1848), more commonly known as Modibo Adamu, was a Fulani scholar and holy warrior who hailed from the Ba'en clan of Fulbe. He led a jihad into the region of Fumbina (in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria), opening the region for Fulani colonisation. As a result of Adamu's constant warring, the Fulani today make up the largest ethnic group in northern Cameroon (at more than 60% of the region's entire population, which, considering the fact that they weren't from the area, is a remarkable feat), and Islam is the dominant religion. The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region. Adamu studied in Hausaland and earned the title \"Modibo\" (\"Lettered One\") for his scholarship. Upon finishing his studies, he returned home to Gurin and learned of the jihad declared by Fulani mystic Usman dan Fodio. When he accompanied a delegation to visit Usman, the leader ordered Adamu to extend his jihad east as \"Lamido Fumbina\" (Ruler of the Southlands). Adamu raised an army and attacked Bata settlements near Gurin. He took the villages, and many more traditional Fulbe leaders and new soldiers came to his side. He next took on Mandara, the largest and best organised state in the region. He swept over several smaller settlements and eventually conquered the Mandara capital, Dulo, with ease. While his men celebrated, however, the Mandara army counterattacked and recaptured the town. Though he fought many more campaigns, Adamu now spent most of his time in Yola, which became his capital. He set about creating the administrative structure of his new state, which he named Adamawa after himself. Adamu ruled the empire, subordinate only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. Below him lay the heads of major settlements, known as Lamibe (singular: Lamido). The village formed the smallest unit of government. Upon Adamu's death in 1847, his son Muhammadu Lawal became Lamido of Adamawa. The empire was not to last, however, as colonial battles and division eventually destroyed the independent Fulani state. The conquest had long-term repercussions, however. The Fulani became the dominant ethnic group in the region, and Islam the major religion. The herdsmen altered the land to be more suitable for herding cattle, their primary pursuit. The jihad also pushed those peoples who had lived on the Adamawa Plateau south into the forest, the single most important event in the populating of southern Cameroon.",

Roll began his coaching career shortly after finishing his college career at Bowling Green, where he was part of the 1984 national championship team, becoming a graduate assistant for his alma mater before joining first-year coach Mark Morris's staff at Clarkson.

Unfortunately, other than a tournament appearance in his second season, Oswego State didn't have much else to show for his tenure until 2002-03 when Roll pushed the Great Lakers to a 25-7-1 record, earning a regular season title, a conference championship, and were runners-up to the D-III national title.\n\nRoll, however, decided against building on his earlier success after he was offered the top job at Clarkson, replacing his mentor Mark Morris after he was fired due to an incident in early November. The first few years with the Golden Knights were rocky as Clarkson couldn't manage a winning record until the third year (and even then it was only by one win), but Clarkson won 25 games in 2006-07, including a conference championship, and when they earned a regular season crown the following season it appeared that they had turned the corner.\n\nAfter that brief success, however, Clarkson declined rapidly, ending with losing records in each of the next three seasons and causing Roll's termination at the end of the 2010-11 season. Roll quickly found a new job as he was announced as the first head coach for Nazareth College's new Division-III ice hockey program that was to begin in 2012-13.

He graduated from the Western University of Pennsylvania (today's University of Pittsburgh) in 1877. He married Anne Love in 1882 and the couple had two children. Clapp took an engineering position at Park Brothers' Black Diamond Steel Works. There, along with Captain Alfred E. Hunt, he established the Pittsburgh Testing Laboratory's chemistry department. Hunt formed a company in 1888 to exploit the Charles Martin Hall patents for making aluminum by electrolysis. Clapp was treasurer and secretary of the fledgling company. He resigned as treasurer in 1892 and was replaced by Andrew W. Mellon. The company later became known as the Aluminium Company of America. While Hall is generally credited with the invention of the aluminum process, Clapp raised the initial venture capital to make the process commercially viable; the Mellon interests supplied the company's working capital.\n\nAs Clapp's wealth grew, he pursued his avocational interests in conchology and numismatics. He had begun collecting coins as a boy in the 1870s by sifting through the coins of a toll bridge across the Allegheny River. He later became a founder of the Western Pennsylvania Numismatic Society. His grandfather encouraged him to start collecting shells; over the years he assembled more than 100,000 mollusk shells, which he later donated to the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. In the 1930s he donated his coin collections to both the American Numismatic Society and the Carnegie.\n\nBeginning in 1907 until his death, Clapp was president of Pitt's Board of Trustees.

    "evidence": "Terence Michael Alderman (born 12 June 1956 in Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia) is a former Australian cricketer who played primarily as a right-arm fast-medium bowler of limited pace but nagging accuracy and movement. He began his first-class career in 1974 with Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield and came to international prominence when he was chosen for the Australian national team to tour England in 1981. In that series, he took 42 test wickets, including nine on debut, the biggest haul in a series since Jim Laker's 46 in 1956 and the fourth-highest total of all time. Alderman's 42 wickets is the record for the most wickets taken in a series without taking 10 wickets in a match. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the Almanack's 1982 edition. He was disabled from playing for over a year by a shoulder injury sustained on 13 November 1982 when he rashly tackled an English-supporting ground invader at the WACA Ground in Perth. Alderman took part in an unofficial Australian tour of South Africa in 1985–86 and 1986–87, when that country was banned from test cricket as a Commonwealth anti-apartheid sanction. As a result, he received a 3-year ban from international cricket which disqualified him from playing in the 1985 Ashes series in England. Following his suspension, Alderman returned to the Australian side and resumed his success against England, taking 41 wickets in the 1989 Ashes series and another 16 in the 1990–91 series, his final Ashes appearance. He rarely enjoyed similar success against other countries. His final test series was against the West Indies in 1990–91, where he ended his career with 170 test wickets. He was a poor batsman, passing fifty just once in his career and averaging barely eight in first-class cricket. He had three seasons in English county cricket, with Kent (1984 and 1986) and then with Gloucestershire (1988). He now works as a courier for Mercury in Western Australia. On 28 July 2000, Alderman was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for being the all-time leading wicket taker for Western Australia. Alderman's sister Denise Emerson is married to former test umpire Ross Emerson and herself played seven tests for the Australian women's cricket team.

She is known for her two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and for developing a philosophical system she called Objectivism. Born and educated in Russia, Rand moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935–1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful in America, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead. In 1957, she published her best-known work, the novel Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982.\n\nRand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism, and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, instead supporting \"laissez-faire\" capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for some Aristotelians and classical liberals. Literary critics received Rand's fiction with mixed reviews, and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings. She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.",

    "evidence": "Royce Campbell is a jazz guitarist primarily associated with mainstream jazz, but he has also released smooth jazz and post-bop jazz recordings. He was born in Seymour, Indiana, in 1952. The son of a career Navy man, Campbell grew up in various cities around the U.S. and abroad, including Asia, Europe, and the West Indies. Exposure to various musical genres while a child contributed to Campbell's musical style and approach in jazz composition and playing. A love for rock and roll marked Campbell's first connection with the guitar, at the age of nine, when he discovered Chuck Berry. Like many guitarists of his generation, Campbell was also influenced by Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. By the time Royce finished high school in the early 1970s, he was certain he wanted to pursue a professional career in music. His uncle, Carroll Decamp, an arranger/pianist who arranged for Stan Kenton and Les Elgart, invited Royce to live with him and study in Indiana, providing most of Royce's musical education in theory and composition. By age 21, Campbell had begun touring with R&B artist Marvin Gaye and developing his talents for stage performance. In 1975, Royce was hired by a local music contractor to do three concerts with award-winning film composer Henry Mancini in Indianapolis. Soon after, Royce became the touring guitarist with Henry Mancini's orchestra, holding that position until Mancini's death in 1994. While appearing on recordings as a sideman, and a couple as leader, during the early years of his career, Campbell started recording and touring more on his own during the 1990s, focusing at first on mainstream or straight-ahead jazz. Although he cites Wes Montgomery as his main influence, the influence of horn players such as Dexter Gordon and Chet Baker are evident in Royce's melodic style. In 1993, he produced Project G-5: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery, which also featured guitarists Tal Farlow, Jimmy Raney, Herb Ellis, and Cal Collins. His 1994 album 6x6 featured guitarists Pat Martino, John Abercrombie, Larry Coryell, Dave Stryker, and Bucky Pizzarelli. With Project G-5: A Tribute to Joe Pass, in 1999, he combined the talents of Charlie Byrd, Gene Bertoncini, Mundell Lowe, and John Pisano. During his career, Royce Campbell has released more than 30 CDs as leader or co-leader, among various sideman projects. Fifteen of these CDs have made it onto the US National Jazz Radio Charts. Campbell's soloing is documented among other jazz guitarists of the era, in Mel Bay's Anthology of Jazz Guitar Solos: Featuring Solos by the World's Finest Jazz Guitarists! In November 2010, Royce Campbell was inducted into the Indianapolis Jazz Foundation Hall of Fame.",

He had previously served two terms in the United States House of Representatives. Harrison was the first cousin twice removed of President William Henry Harrison.

He was born on December 14 in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania (now a part of Pittsburgh), the son of Delia Dennig Hubbard and Dewitt Clinton Clapp, an iron company executive. He graduated from the Western University of Pennsylvania (today's University of Pittsburgh) in 1877. He married Anne Love in 1882 and the couple had two children. Clapp took an engineering position at Park Brothers' Black Diamond Steel Works. There, along with Captain Alfred E. Hunt, he established the Pittsburgh Testing Laboratory's chemistry department. Hunt formed a company in 1888 to exploit the Charles Martin Hall patents for making aluminum by electrolysis. Clapp was treasurer and secretary of the fledgling company. He resigned as treasurer in 1892 and was replaced by Andrew W. Mellon. The company later became known as the Aluminium Company of America. While Hall is generally credited with the invention of the aluminum process, Clapp raised the initial venture capital to make the process commercially viable; the Mellon interests supplied the company's working capital.\n\nAs Clapp's wealth grew, he pursued his avocational interests in conchology and numismatics. He had begun collecting coins as a boy in the 1870s by sifting through the coins of a toll bridge across the Allegheny River. He later became a founder of the Western Pennsylvania Numismatic Society. His grandfather encouraged him to start collecting shells; over the years he assembled more than 100,000 mollusk shells, which he later donated to the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. In the 1930s he donated his coin collections to both the American Numismatic Society and the Carnegie.\n\nBeginning in 1907 until his death, Clapp was president of Pitt's Board of Trustees. He was a driving force in moving the school from its North Side location to the Oakland district. He also was a trustee of the Carnegie Institute of Technology (today's Carnegie Mellon University) and a member of the American Chemical Society. He died at age 90 on March 31, 1949 at his home in Sewickley, Pennsylvania. Clapp Hall, an academic building on the Pitt campus, is named in his honor.",

Grabau was born in Olvenstedt, Prussia (now a part of Greater Magdeburg, Germany). He was the son of Johann Andreas Grabau and Anna Dorothea Jericho. Grabau was educated at the grammar school in Olvenstedt (1809 - 1818), the Magdeburg Gymnasium (1818 - 1825), and at the University of Halle (1825 - 1829). After three years as a teacher in Magdeburg and Sachsa bei Nordhausen, Grabau was ordained and installed as pastor of St. Andrew's Church in Erfurt in June 1834. Grabau was jailed twice for refusing to use the Prussian Union agenda and was permitted to immigrate to America in summer 1839 with members of Lutheran congregations in Erfurt and Magdeburg. They settled in Buffalo, New York, where he served as pastor of a Lutheran congregation for 40 years. On July 15, 1845, along with four pastors, Grabau founded \"The Synod of the Lutheran Church Emigrated from Prussia\" (German: \"Synode der aus Preussen ausgewanderten lutherischen Kirche\"), which became known as \"The Buffalo Synod\". Grabau also founded the Martin Luther College in Buffalo. Grabau retained control of the Martin Luther College and remained as its rector. The official organ of Grabau's synod after 1866 was \"Die Wachende Kirche\", under his editorship. Grabau was married on July 15, 1834, to Christine Sophia Burgraf, the daughter of Johann Andreas Burggraf and Friedericke Louise Elizabeth Beulke.

Windelband was a Neo-Kantian who protested other Neo-Kantians of his time and maintained that \"to understand Kant rightly means to go beyond him\". Against his positivist contemporaries, Windelband argued that philosophy should engage in humanistic dialogue with the natural sciences rather than uncritically appropriating its methodologies. His interests in psychology and cultural sciences represented an opposition to psychologism and historicism schools by a critical philosophic system. Windelband relied in his effort to reach beyond Kant on such philosophers as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Johann Friedrich Herbart, and Hermann Lotze. Closely associated with Windelband was Heinrich Rickert. Windelband's disciples were not only noted philosophers, but sociologists like Max Weber and theologians like Ernst Troeltsch and Albert Schweitzer.",

Dananjaya had at that point played no first-class, List A, T20, or even U-19 cricket. This in turn led to controversy as his selection was questioned by the media on the basis of a net performance. He was selected to play for Wayamba United in the inaugural Sri Lanka Premier League. In only his second match for the franchise, he took 3-18 against Nagenahira Nagas, consistently disturbing the batsmen with his flight, googly, and other variations. This in turn led to a place in the final squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20. In the 2013 IPL auctions, Dananjaya was sold to the Chennai Super Kings for his base price of $20,000.",

    "evidence": "Joseph E. \"Joe\" Brown (April 4, 1859 - June 28, 1888 in Warren, Pennsylvania) was a pitcher/utility player in Major League Baseball for the Chicago White Stockings and Baltimore Orioles. It was relatively common in the 19th century for baseball teams to use a reserve fielder as a pitcher, and this appears to be true in Brown's case. He appeared in 15 games for the 1884 Cubs (debuting August 16), pitching in seven of those games, six as a starter. His mark that season was 4-2 with a 4.68 ERA. He also played center field, right field, first baseman, and catcher for the Cubs that season, hitting .213 with 3 RBI in 61 trips to the plate. Brown found himself with the American Association's Orioles in the 1886 season in a similar role for a brief period of time. He pitched in four games, completing and losing each one for a record of 0-4 and an ERA of 5.68. He also appeared in one game as a second baseman. Brown was 3-for-19 at the plate in 1886 to finish his career with a batting average of exactly .200 (16-for-80). Brown died on June 28, 1888 in his birthplace of Warren, Pennsylvania, aged just 29.",

A graduate of St. Joseph's College in Memramcook and the New Brunswick Teachers' College in Fredericton, Lévesque taught school before entering political life. A resident of Edmundston, New Brunswick, he was first elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 1960 New Brunswick general election as a Liberal Party candidate for one of the three seats for Madawaska County. He was reelected in 1963, 1967, and 1970. In the 1974 election, he lost by 95 votes to the Progressive Conservative candidate Jean-Pierre Ouellet in the newly created riding of Madawaska-les-Lacs. Without the Parti Acadien contesting the riding, Lévesque may have won; the Parti Acadien received 99 votes, ones that are generally accepted as being traditional Liberal supporters. Lévesque attempted a political comeback in the City of Edmundston riding in 1982 but lost to Jean-Maurice Simard.\n\nAs a member of the Legislative Assembly in the government of Premier Louis Robichaud, Lévesque was an ardent defender of Francophone rights and was one of the first members to give his speeches in the Assembly in the French language. Out of politics, in 1990 the Government of Canada appointed him to diplomatic missions abroad which organized and supervised democratic elections in 10 African countries, in two countries from the former Soviet Union, as well as in Bosnia and Herzegovina.",

After winning the California and South Dakota primary elections for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States, Kennedy was shot as he walked through the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel and died in the Good Samaritan Hospital twenty-six hours later. Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian/Jordanian immigrant, was convicted of Kennedy's murder and is serving a life sentence for the crime. The shooting was recorded on audio tape by a freelance newspaper reporter, and the aftermath was captured on film. Kennedy's body lay in repose at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York for two days before a funeral mass was held on June 8. His body was interred near his brother John at Arlington National Cemetery. His death prompted the protection of presidential candidates by the United States Secret Service. Hubert Humphrey went on to win the Democratic nomination for the presidency, but ultimately lost the election to Richard Nixon. As with his brother John's death, Kennedy's assassination and the circumstances surrounding it have spawned a variety of conspiracy theories. As of 2015, Kennedy remains one of only two sitting United States Senators to be assassinated, the other being Huey Long.",

    "evidence": "Royce Campbell is a jazz guitarist primarily associated with mainstream jazz, but he has also released smooth jazz and post-bop jazz recordings. He was born in Seymour, Indiana, in 1952. The son of a career Navy man, Campbell grew up in various cities around the U.S. and abroad, including Asia, Europe, and the West Indies. Exposure to various musical genres while a child contributed to Campbell's musical style and approach in jazz composition and playing. A love for rock and roll marked Campbell's first connection with the guitar, at the age of nine, when he discovered Chuck Berry. Like many guitarists of his generation, Campbell was also influenced by Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. By the time Royce finished high school in the early 1970s, he was certain he wanted to pursue a professional career in music. His uncle, Carroll Decamp, an arranger/pianist who arranged for Stan Kenton and Les Elgart, invited Royce to live with him and study in Indiana, providing most of Royce's musical education in theory and composition. By age 21, Campbell had begun touring with R&B artist Marvin Gaye and developing his talents for stage performance. In 1975, Royce was hired by a local music contractor to do three concerts with award-winning film composer Henry Mancini in Indianapolis. Soon after, Royce became the touring guitarist with Henry Mancini's orchestra, holding that position until Mancini's death in 1994. While appearing on recordings as a sideman, and a couple as leader, during the early years of his career, Campbell started recording and touring more on his own during the 1990s, focusing at first on mainstream or straight-ahead jazz. Although he cites Wes Montgomery as his main influence, the influence of horn players such as Dexter Gordon and Chet Baker are evident in Royce's melodic style. In 1993, he produced Project G-5: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery, which also featured guitarists Tal Farlow, Jimmy Raney, Herb Ellis, and Cal Collins. His 1994 album 6x6 featured guitarists Pat Martino, John Abercrombie, Larry Coryell, Dave Stryker, and Bucky Pizzarelli. With Project G-5: A Tribute to Joe Pass, in 1999, he combined the talents of Charlie Byrd, Gene Bertoncini, Mundell Lowe, and John Pisano. During his career, Royce Campbell has released more than 30 CDs as leader or co-leader, among various sideman projects. Fifteen of these CDs have made it onto the US National Jazz Radio Charts. Campbell's soloing is documented among other jazz guitarists of the era, in Mel Bay's Anthology of Jazz Guitar Solos: Featuring Solos by the World's Finest Jazz Guitarists! In November 2010, Royce Campbell was inducted into the Indianapolis Jazz Foundation Hall of Fame.",

Finchem had previously served as Vice President of Business Affairs, Deputy Commissioner, and Chief Operating Officer of the Tour. Finchem graduated from Princess Anne High School in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He attended the University of Richmond on a debate scholarship, receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1969. He graduated from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1973. After practicing law in Virginia Beach for three years, Finchem served in the White House during the administration of Jimmy Carter as Deputy Advisor to the President in the Office of Economic Affairs in 1978 and 1979. In the early 1980s, Finchem co-founded the National Marketing and Strategies Group in Washington, D.C. As Commissioner, Finchem has greatly expanded the earnings opportunities for PGA Tour players both domestically and internationally. He has presided over the last three television broadcasting deals (1997, 2001 and 2005) and has maximized the earnings potential of the Tour, and perhaps none was as bold as the most recent deal that excludes ABC and ESPN and challenges the Golf Channel to get better. In 2006, the total PGA Tour purse was $256.8 million, up from $56.4 million in 1994. That remarkable growth has a lot to do with Tiger Woods, but Finchem's supporters also give him some of the credit.

His most productive season came in 1945, when he posted career-highs in average (.310), home runs (27), RBI (104), runs (108), doubles (27), slugging percentage (.544) and on-base percentage (.420). An All-Star during five consecutive seasons (1943–47), Kurowski exceeded the 20 home run mark three times to set a major league record for a third baseman (1944–45, 1947), and hit over .300 three times (1945–47). He also led the National League three times in putouts, twice in fielding percentage, and once in double plays. In four World Series appearances, Kurowski hit .253 (21-for-83) with one home run and nine RBI in 23 games, as the Cardinals were world champions in 1942, 1944 and 1946. His only home run in the series, in 1942, off Red Ruffing, broke a 2–2 tie in the ninth inning of Game Five to clinch the title for St. Louis over the New York Yankees. He also appeared five times in the MVP ballot, in 1942 and from 1944 through 1947. In 1949, Kurowski developed arm and elbow problems and his playing career ended. After that, he coached and managed in the minor leagues for 18 years until 1972. He gained induction into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame in 1988. In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \"All-Time All-Star Argument Starter,\" consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Kurowski was the third baseman on Stein's Polish team. Kurowski died in Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania, at age 81.",

    "evidence": "Johannes Andreas August Grabau (March 18, 1804 - June 2, 1879) was an influential German-American Old Lutheran pastor and theologian. He is usually mentioned as J.A.A. Grabau. Grabau was born in Olvenstedt, Prussia (now a part of Greater Magdeburg, Germany). He was the son of Johann Andreas Grabau and Anna Dorothea Jericho. Grabau was educated at the grammar school in Olvenstedt (1809 - 1818), the Magdeburg Gymnasium (1818 - 1825), and at the University of Halle (1825 - 1829). After three years as a teacher in Magdeburg and Sachsa bei Nordhausen, Grabau was ordained and installed as pastor of St. Andrew's Church in Erfurt in June 1834. Grabau was jailed twice for refusing to use the Prussian Union agenda and was permitted to immigrate to America in summer 1839 with members of Lutheran congregations in Erfurt and Magdeburg. They settled in Buffalo, New York, where he served as pastor of a Lutheran congregation for 40 years. On July 15, 1845, along with four pastors, Grabau founded \"The Synod of the Lutheran Church Emigrated from Prussia\" (German: \"Synode der aus Preussen ausgewanderten lutherischen Kirche\"), which became known as \"The Buffalo Synod\". Grabau also founded the Martin Luther College in Buffalo. Grabau retained control of the Martin Luther College and remained as its rector. The official organ of Grabau's synod after 1866 was \"Die Wachende Kirche\", under his editorship. Grabau was married on July 15, 1834, to Christine Sophia Burgraf, the daughter of Johann Andreas Burggraf and Friedericke Louise Elizabeth Beulke. They had at least three children: Johann, Wilhelm, and Beata. Grabau died on June 2, 1879 in Buffalo, New York, shortly before the 40th anniversary of his arrival in the United States.",

    "claim": "John Russell Reynolds (1820–1876) was an English lawyer, judge, and author.",
    "evidence": "Sir John Russell Reynolds, 1st Baronet (22 May 1828 – 29 May 1896) was a British neurologist and physician. Reynolds was born in Romsey, Hampshire, as the son of John Reynolds, an independent minister, and the grandson of Dr. Henry Revell Reynolds. He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851, he graduated M.B. in the University of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852, he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a Fellow of the College in 1859. In the same year, he was appointed Assistant Physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 Assistant Physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865, he became Professor of the Principles and Practice of Medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen's Household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 Vice-President of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian Lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian Oration in 1884, and was elected President in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a Baronet. In the winter of 1895–96, he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as President of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children. The \"Reynolds Baronetcy\", of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death. Reynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an \"Essay on Vertigo\"; in 1855 \"Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves\", as well as \"Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain\"; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 \"Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity\"; in 1872 \"The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity\"; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the \"System of Medicine\", in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write – compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a \"Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe\". Reynolds was a tall man, with dark hair, with a dignified delivery and some oratorical power. Reynolds died in London.",

For his actions in World War II, Foster was awarded both the Silver Star and the Légion d'Honneur. At the end of the war, Göring surrendered to the Allied Powers in the Bavarian Alps. On May 9, 1945, Foster transported Göring back to Germany on a 55-minute flight in an unescorted, unarmed L-5, a larger plane than the L4 he normally piloted, because Göring weighed more than. According to \"China Daily\", in a letter to his wife, Virginia, written at the time, Foster describes his first impression of Göring as \"effeminate gave me the creeps...several times I had the impulse to turn the plane over and see if I could shake him out, but he was wedged in like a champagne cork.\" Foster said that Göring, who spoke some English, avoided any talk of Adolf Hitler, with whom Göring – as the commander of the Luftwaffe – had fallen out of favor as the total German defeat neared. \"He acted as though he was going on a sightseeing tour, or really as though I was going on a sightseeing tour, and he was showing me where he grew up. I had a .45 in a shoulder holster, but he couldn't reach that. But neither could I, because I had two hands controlling the plane.\" Foster further recalled Göring as having been sharp, friendly, and witty, having joked when Foster asked him when Germany began manufacturing jets. \"Too late,\" Göring was said to have answered. Foster continued: \"I could see that he was like one of our officers if he'd been picked up. I questioned all that we knew about these vicious people.\" Göring was convicted of war crimes and committed suicide in October 1946 by taking a cyanide capsule before he could be hanged by the Nuremberg authorities.\n\nBy October 1945, Foster was back in the United States, having flown seventy reconnaissance combat missions during his wartime service. He returned to his adopted home state of Montana, where he was appointed Lieutenant Colonel in the Montana Army National Guard.

It was not until 2009 that he received the French Legion of Honor, when Pierre Vimont, the French Ambassador to the United States, released a letter hailing Foster for his \"personal, precious contribution to the United States' decisive role in the liberation of our country during World War II.\" Foster died at the age of ninety-nine in a nursing home in Missoula, Montana. His last city of residence was Livingston in Park County, Montana. Survivors included son-in-law Roy E. Korkalo of Livingston, grandson Chris Korkalo, and a sister, Priscilla F. Howell.",

He graduated from the Western University of Pennsylvania (today's University of Pittsburgh) in 1877. He married Anne Love in 1882 and the couple had two children. Clapp took an engineering position at Park Brothers' Black Diamond Steel Works. There, along with Captain Alfred E. Hunt, he established the Pittsburgh Testing Laboratory's chemistry department. Hunt formed a company in 1888 to exploit the Charles Martin Hall patents for making aluminum by electrolysis. Clapp was treasurer and secretary of the fledgling company. He resigned as treasurer in 1892 and was replaced by Andrew W. Mellon. The company later became known as the Aluminium Company of America. While Hall is generally credited with the invention of the aluminum process, Clapp raised the initial venture capital to make the process commercially viable; the Mellon interests supplied the company's working capital.\n\nAs Clapp's wealth grew, he pursued his avocational interests in conchology and numismatics. He had begun collecting coins as a boy in the 1870s by sifting through the coins of a toll bridge across the Allegheny River. He later became a founder of the Western Pennsylvania Numismatic Society. His grandfather encouraged him to start collecting shells; over the years he assembled more than 100,000 mollusk shells, which he later donated to the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.

This epic effort brought to light the main contents of the book, a wealth of botanical information on Malabar that had largely remained inaccessible to English-speaking scholars, because the entire text was in the Latin language. Despite the existence of Hendrik van Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus over the last three centuries, the correct taxonomic identity of many plants listed in Hortus Malabaricus, their medicinal properties, methods of use, etc., as described and codified by renowned traditional medical authorities of 17th century India remained inaccessible to English language-based scholars, until Manilal commenced publication of research papers and books on Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal's efforts ultimately resulted in an English edition of Hortus Malabaricus, for the first time, 325 years after its original publication from Amsterdam. The English edition contains a word-by-word translation of all the twelve volumes of the book, retaining the original style of language. Medicinal properties of plants are translated and interpreted, with commentaries on their Malayalam names given by van Rheede. In addition, the correct scientific identity of all plants, acceptable under ICBN, are set out along with their important synonyms and basionyms. Whilst the scope of Manilal's contributions to botany extend far beyond the research and publications around Hortus Malabaricus, his research work on Hortus Malabaricus alone are of botanical and socio-historic significance, and can be broadly classified under two heads: botanical and medicinal aspects of Hortus Malabaricus; and historical, political, social, and linguistic aspects of Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal has over 198 published research papers and 15 books to his credit as author and co-author. He and his associates have credits to discovering over 14 species of flowering plants, varieties, and combinations new to science.

She was born in Trier, Germany, where her father was stationed. Yvonne de Gaulle was struck by an automobile shortly before Anne's birth. She was born with Down syndrome and lived with her family until her death. De Gaulle's relatives all testified that the general, who was normally undemonstrative in his affections for his family, was more open and extroverted with Anne. He would entertain her with songs, dances, and pantomimes. In October 1945, Yvonne de Gaulle bought the Château de Vert-Cœur at Milon-la-Chapelle (Yvelines), where they installed a private hospital for handicapped young girls: the \"Fondation Anne de Gaulle\". Anne died of pneumonia on 6 February 1948, aged 20, at Colombey-les-Deux-Églises. Upon her death, her father said: \"Now, she's like the others.\" (\"Maintenant, elle est comme les autres.\") On 22 August 1962, Charles de Gaulle was the victim of an attempted assassination at Petit-Clamart. He later said that the potentially fatal bullet had been stopped by the frame of the photograph of Anne that he always carried with him, placed this particular day on the rear shelf of his car. When he died in 1970, he was buried in the cemetery of Colombey beside his beloved daughter.",

Under the orders of Frederick I, he had to set him free, but he was able to obtain the title. Nevertheless, the conflict with his brother continued as he tried to regain the Margraviate. After Albert died in 1195 with no children to succeed him, Meissen, with its rich mines, was seized by the Emperor Henry VI as a vacant fief of the Empire.

He played for the Buffalo Bisons, Detroit Wolverines, Kansas City Cowboys, Baltimore Orioles, and Cincinnati Red Stockings (AA). At the start of the 1882 season, clubs playing in the American Association had their players wear non-matching silk uniforms, with a different color and/or pattern corresponding to each position in the field. Accordingly, on opening day for the Red Stockings, Stearns wore an unusual candy-striped jersey. On September 11, 1882, Stearns was involved in a notable milestone, when pitcher Tony Mullane of the Louisville Eclipse pitched the first no-hit game in the history of the American Association against Stearns and his teammates on the Cincinnati Red Stockings, a 2-0 win by Louisville. Stearns made the game's final out by bouncing into a fielder's choice that forced runner Pop Snyder at second base. The Red Stockings had the last laugh, however, ending the year as the AA's inaugural champions. Unsatisfied with their first-base play in 1882, the Red Stockings signed Long John Reilly of the New York Metropolitans to replace Stearns prior to the 1883 season. Stearns spent the 1887 season with the Topeka Golden Giants of the Western League, leading that league in hits. That team finished with a dominant record of 90-25, and is sometimes described as the strongest minor league baseball club of the 19th century. Stearns is also notable as one of the first Jews to play Major League Baseball. His status as such made him popular with Jewish youths who were fans of the game.",

His personal name was Xiong Lü, ancestral name Mi (芈), and King Zhuang was his posthumous title. He became one of the Five Hegemons and attempted to wrest control of China from the King of Zhou. King Zhuang ascended the throne in 613 BC at a time when the kingdom of Chu was in disarray. For the first three years of his reign, Zhuang wasted time on excessive hunting and lavish partying. Several courtiers were anxious about the king, but none dared speak up as he had given orders that anyone who challenged his authority would be killed. When a particularly senior minister challenged him through a riddle, the king responded that he had been waiting for three years for someone from his court to show some nationalistic pride. The king made Sunshu Ao chancellor and began a series of reforms. Chu's agricultural output improved significantly during his reign, aided by Sunshu Ao's comprehensive dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir created in modern-day northern Anhui province. In 611 BC he annexed the state of Yong (庸国), a move which made Chu much stronger. After some overwhelming victories at the head of his army, King Zhuang attempted to take the place of King Ding of Zhou. He asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the nine tripod cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China at the time, but was rebuffed. In the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the state of Jin, another strong state at that time. Later he achieved hegemony amongst some other states. His progress from lazy regent to a hegemon of his time gave rise to the Chinese four-character idiom of \"Yī Mǐng Jīng Rén\" (一冥而惊人).",

    "evidence": "Pattern is Movement (often stylized as Pattern is Movement) is an American indie rock band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that was established in 2001. They have been categorized by some reviewers as a math rock group and compared to groups such as Don Caballero, Sunny Day Real Estate, and Pinback. However, as the band moved from a five-piece to a two-piece, their sound moved away from the angular sound of previous records and closer to a more melodic heavy composition structure with sing-a-long choruses. The current two-piece sound can be attributed to influences such as Dirty Projectors, Beirut, and Grizzly Bear. In an interview with Baeble Music, Ward coined the band with the term \"indie cabaret\". In 2006, producer and engineer Scott Solter (who has worked with John Vanderslice and The Mountain Goats) remixed the 2005 album Stowaway, which he had also recorded. This remix was considered unique due to its exclusivity to analog processes. Solter is credited on the album with \"machines, razors, tape\". Since 2008, Pattern is Movement have been performing as a two-piece. On the January 2008 issue of Philadelphia Weekly, they were featured in a cover story citing \"four indie bands that can expect a big year\". The band emerged with a new album, All Together, documenting the lineup in the spring of 2008, also recorded with Solter. In his favorable review, Pitchfork Media writer Joe Tangari described it as \"an accessible album that nonetheless sounds unlike what any other band is doing\". In April 2009, they became one of Limewire's featured artists. In 2015, after releasing their self-titled fourth album, Pattern is Movement announced their farewell tour.",

    "evidence": "Ayn Rand (born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum; March 6, 1982) was a Russian-born American novelist, philosopher, playwright, and screenwriter. She is known for her two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and for developing a philosophical system she called Objectivism. Born and educated in Russia, Rand moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935–1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful in America, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead. In 1957, she published her best-known work, the novel Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982.\n\nRand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism, and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, instead supporting \"laissez-faire\" capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for some Aristotelians and classical liberals. Literary critics received Rand's fiction with mixed reviews, and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings. She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.",

    "evidence": "Philip (29 August 1116 – 13 October 1131) was the King of France from 1129, co-ruling with his father, Louis VI. His mother was Louis VI's second wife, Adelaide of Maurienne. The favourite son of his father as a child, Philip was enthroned alongside Louis VI as joint king in 1129. However, the young king gave his father little joy after that, refusing to pay attention to the old king or to follow the high standards that Louis himself followed. He became disobedient, refusing to heed scoldings or warnings; Walter Map said that he \"strayed from the paths of conduct travelled by his father and, by his overweening pride and tyrannical arrogance, made himself a burden to all.\" Philip's brief period as king was ended two years after his coronation. Riding with a group of companions along the Seine, in the Parisian market section named the Greve, his running horse was tripped by a black pig which darted out of a dung heap on the quay. The horse fell forwards, and the young king was catapulted over its head. The fall \"so dreadfully fractured his limbs that he died on the day following\" without regaining consciousness. He was buried at St Denis, and succeeded as heir, and co-king, by his pious brother, Louis the Younger (now known as Louis VII).\n\nIf Philip had been little other than trouble and a problem to his family and kingdom whilst he had lived, his legacy would prove greater trouble still. Whilst he had lived, he had nurtured a dream of visiting Jerusalem and the tomb of Christ; when he died, his brother, Louis VII, vowed to go in Philip's place. This vow would provide a reason for Louis joining the disastrous Second Crusade and an excuse to abandon Antioch in favour of Jerusalem. The Crusade brought many deaths on both sides, and the abandonment of Antioch proved a strategic failure and a partial cause for the collapse of the marriage between Louis and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Because he was co-king rather than a king in his own right, he is not generally given a number in the succession of Kings of France.",

    "evidence": "Lieutenant Junior Grade Tetsuzō Iwamoto was one of the top-scoring aces among the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force (IJNAF) fighter pilots. He entered the Imperial Navy in 1934 and completed pilot training in December 1936. His first combat occurred over China in early 1938, and he emerged as the top naval ace of the campaign, credited with 14 aerial victories. Subsequently, he flew Zeros from the aircraft carrier Zuikaku from December 1941 to May 1942, including at the Battle of the Coral Sea. In late 1943, Iwamoto's air group was sent to Rabaul, New Britain, resulting in three months of the hardest air combat ever undertaken by the IJNAF against air raids mounted by U.S. and Allied air units. Subsequent assignments were Truk Atoll in the Carolines and the Philippines, and he was commissioned an Ensign in October 1944. Following the evacuation of the Philippines, Iwamoto served in home defense and trained Kamikaze pilots. Like many Japanese veterans, Iwamoto was reported to have fallen into depression after the war. His diary was found after his death, with claims of 202 Allied aircraft destroyed. As a result of the Japanese use of the British naval practices, the IJNAF scoring system was based on the system the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force (RAF) adopted from World War I until World War II. This system differed from the scoring system used by the U.S. Navy Air Force and U.S. Marine Air Force during World War II. Dr. Izawa and Professor Hata estimated the figure at about 80 or more than 87 in their research work in January 1971. In December 1993, Izawa wrote that Iwamoto was \"virtually\" the top ace of the IJNAF. As of mid-1944, there remained only two IJNAF fighter pilots who were credited with over 100 victories. Depending on various totals cited, Tetsuzō Iwamoto or Hiroyoshi Nishizawa was Japan's best ace. Iwamoto was known as the Chūtai leader (flying company, squadron of 8 to 16 fighters). Iwamoto was one of few survivors of the IJNAF from the early part of the Second World War. He fought over the Indian and the Pacific Ocean from north to south, and trained his young pilots even in the last months of the war.",

    "evidence": "Geoffrey Merton \"Geoff\" Griffin (12 June 1939 - 16 November 2006) was a cricketer who played two Tests for South Africa in 1960. In his second Test appearance in 1960 at Lord's, he became the first (and, as of November 2014, only) South African cricketer to take a hat-trick in a Test match, and also the first and only cricketer to take a Test hat-trick at Lord's. He is best known for being no-balled for throwing in his second Test and the exhibition match that followed, and he never played Test cricket again.\n\nGriffin was born in Greytown in the former Natal Province and was educated at Durban High School. He was tall and blond, and excelled in many sports, playing hockey for Rhodesia and under-19s rugby for Natal. He was also Natal champion in the high jump, long jump, triple jump and pole vault. Griffin suffered an accident in childhood which rendered him unable to straighten his right arm.\n\nThere was continuing controversy about bowlers \"throwing\" or \"chucking\" the ball (that is, flexing their elbow in the action of bowling the ball, which is contrary to the laws of cricket). The issue had been controversial since the editor of Wisden, Sydney Pardon, claimed that Australian fast bowler Ernest Jones was throwing in the tour of England in 1896, and then Jones and C. B. Fry were both no-balled in the Melbourne Test in 1897. The issue achieved renewed prominence following the Ashes series in Australia in 1958-59, when Australians Ian Meckiff and Gordon Rorke were suspected of throwing. Other fast bowlers, such as West Indies' Charlie Griffith and New Zealand's Gary Bartlett were also suspected. The MCC was determined to stamp out the problem before the Ashes series in England in 1961, and English umpires were instructed to strictly enforce the rule against throwing in 1960.\n\nGriffin made his first-class cricket debut for Natal in the 1957-58 South African domestic season, as a fast bowler. Despite being no-balled in South African provincial matches in the 1959-60 season, Griffin finished at the top of the averages, with 35 wickets at a bowling average of 12.23, and was selected to tour England in 1960, aged 20. Griffin was no-balled 8 times during the tour match against the MCC at Lord's in May 1960, the first time that a touring player was called for throwing, and no-balled again several times by various umpires in matches against the counties. He tried to change his action at Alf Gover's indoor school, and was not called once in the 42 overs that he bowled in the 1st Test at Edgbaston, although his pace was much reduced. In the search for quicker deliveries, he fell back into his old faults, and was called in a tour match against Hampshire. English umpires Frank Lee and Syd Buller repeatedly called Geoff Griffin for throwing in the 2nd Test, at Lord's, starting from his third over.\n\nAfter being no-balled 5 times on the first day and 6 times on the second day, he returned for a final bowling spell on Saturday 25 June and dismissed M. J. K. Smith with the last ball of one over, caught behind by John Waite for 99, and then bowled Peter Walker and Fred Trueman with the first two balls of his next over. This was the first Test cricket hat-trick claimed by a South African cricketer. England immediately declared their first innings for 362 with 8 wickets down. England quickly dismissed South Africa twice to win by an innings and 73 runs, just after lunch on the fourth day, Monday 27 June, with Brian Statham taking 6-62 and 5-34.\n\nA 20-over exhibition match was arranged to fill the period until the scheduled presentation of the players to the Queen at tea. Griffin was again repeatedly no-balled in the exhibition match for throwing, and was also no-balled for failing to notify the umpires that he was changing to bowl underarm to complete an over. Griffin later recounted that Donald Bradman came to the dressing room to console him, and let him know that the umpires were acting on order from MCC President Gubby Allen. Griffin remained on the tour as a batsman, but never played Test cricket again.\n\nMany spectators could see no difference between his \"legitimate\" deliveries, and the ones that were no-balled: many concluded that he threw every delivery. The public saw him as a martyr and scapegoat, and he was warmly applauded by the spectators at all of his subsequent tour matches. None of the controversial Australian bowlers from the 1958-59 Ashes series toured England in 1961. He moved to play for Rhodesia, but his cricket career ended less than 2 years later, at the age of 23, after he was no-balled playing in a Currie Cup match against North Eastern Transvaal at Salisbury.\n\nIn retirement from cricket, he played club cricket, was a cricket coach, and worked as a hotel manager for South African Breweries in Durban, at the Argyll, and then at the Congela Hotel. He married twice. Griffin died of a heart attack in Durban.",

    "evidence": "The Blood Divine was a British gothic metal band, founded in the summer of 1995 by Paul Allender, brothers Paul and Benjamin Ryan, after the three left Cradle of Filth during the recording of the \"V Empire (or Dark Faerytales in Phallustein)\" EP and ousted Anathema singer Darren White. They recruited drummer William A. \"W.A.S.\" Sarginson and bassist Steve Maloney and were quickly signed up by Peaceville Records. Their debut album \"Awaken\" was recorded in early 1996 and released through Peaceville Records later that year. At the end of 1996, they toured throughout Europe with Cathedral and label mates My Dying Bride. In the early summer of 1997, they recorded their second album, \"Mystica\", and guitarist Paul Allender left the band to spend more time with his family (however, he eventually rejoined Cradle of Filth). Mystica was released later that year, again through Peaceville Records. The album had less of a goth sound and more of a classic rock-influenced progressive sound. The band continued and toured as a five-piece, touring the UK with Orange Goblin supporting and then a short tour of Holland at the beginning of 1998. The band were looking to develop their sound and keyboard player Benjamin Ryan was told to leave the band in April 1998. However, this dismayed Paul Ryan, and shortly afterwards the band split up. In 2002, Peaceville released the Blood Divine compilation album \"Rise Pantheon Dreams\". The tracklist included songs from both \"Awaken\" and \"Mystica\", as well as two previously-unreleased tracks (\"Revolt\" and \"Forever Belongs\"), a live version of \"Aureole\", and a live cover of The Osmonds' \"Crazy Horses\". Allender later rejoined Cradle of Filth. Sarginson briefly joined Cradle of Filth before the band settled in with Swedish drummer Adrian Erlandsson, who was later replaced by Martin Škaroupka. In 2004, Darren White formed a new band, Serotonal.",

    "evidence": "Daniel Eckford Stearns (born October 17, 1861 in Buffalo, New York - June 28, 1944 in Glendale, California), commonly known as \"Ecky\" Stearns, was a Major League Baseball first baseman. He played for the Buffalo Bisons, Detroit Wolverines, Kansas City Cowboys, Baltimore Orioles, and Cincinnati Red Stockings (AA). At the start of the 1882 season, clubs playing in the American Association had their players wear non-matching silk uniforms, with a different color and/or pattern corresponding to each position in the field. Accordingly, on opening day for the Red Stockings, Stearns wore an unusual candy-striped jersey. On September 11, 1882, Stearns was involved in a notable milestone, when pitcher Tony Mullane of the Louisville Eclipse pitched the first no-hit game in the history of the American Association against Stearns and his teammates on the Cincinnati Red Stockings, a 2-0 win by Louisville. Stearns made the game's final out by bouncing into a fielder's choice that forced runner Pop Snyder at second base. The Red Stockings had the last laugh, however, ending the year as the AA's inaugural champions. Unsatisfied with their first-base play in 1882, the Red Stockings signed Long John Reilly of the New York Metropolitans to replace Stearns prior to the 1883 season. Stearns spent the 1887 season with the Topeka Golden Giants of the Western League, leading that league in hits. That team finished with a dominant record of 90-25, and is sometimes described as the strongest minor league baseball club of the 19th century. Stearns is also notable as one of the first Jews to play Major League Baseball. His status as such made him popular with Jewish youths who were fans of the game.",

His military career was distinguished. A member of Alexander the Great's personal bodyguard, he went on to command the Companion Cavalry and was entrusted with many other tasks throughout Alexander's ten-year campaign in Asia, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges, and the foundation of new settlements. Besides being a soldier, engineer, and diplomat, he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate the Greeks and Persians. Alexander formally made him his second-in-command when he appointed him Chiliarch of the Empire. Alexander also made him part of the royal family when he gave him as his bride Drypetis, sister to his own second wife Stateira, both daughters of Darius III of Persia. When he died suddenly at Ecbatana around age thirty-two, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief. He petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant Hephaestion divine status, and thus Hephaestion was honored as a \"divine hero\". Hephaestion was cremated in Babylon in the presence of the entire army. At the time of his own death a mere eight months later, Alexander was still planning lasting monuments to Hephaestion's memory.",

Tobin attended the University of Missouri, where he played in the Tigers' backfield next to quarterback Jim Johnson. During his time with the Indianapolis Colts, he drafted Hall of Famer Marshall Faulk and future Hall of Famer Marvin Harrison. He also drafted Ken Dilger, Tarik Glenn, and Adam Meadows, who would be cornerstones of the Colts' offensive line. He also built a team in Indianapolis with Jim Harbaugh, who in 1995 led the NFL in passing and had a very successful run in the 1995 NFL playoffs, including the first playoff win for the Colts since Super Bowl V, a span of thirty years. He drafted Ray Buchanan and Ashley Ambrose, who came to be tremendous players in the league and eventually started for the Falcons in the Super Bowl. It could be argued that Bill Tobin laid the foundation for the Peyton Manning era because of the quality players he drafted. Tobin was replaced as Colts general manager in 1997 by Bill Polian. Tobin is the brother of former NFL coach Vince Tobin. Tobin is currently working as a scout for the Cincinnati Bengals.",

She is known for her two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and for developing a philosophical system she called Objectivism. Born and educated in Russia, Rand moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935–1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful in America, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead. In 1957, she published her best-known work, the novel Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982.\n\nRand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism, and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, instead supporting \"laissez-faire\" capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for some Aristotelians and classical liberals. Literary critics received Rand's fiction with mixed reviews, and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings. She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.",

    "evidence": "Daniel Eckford Stearns (born October 17, 1861 in Buffalo, New York - June 28, 1944 in Glendale, California), commonly known as \"Ecky\" Stearns, was a Major League Baseball first baseman. He played for the Buffalo Bisons, Detroit Wolverines, Kansas City Cowboys, Baltimore Orioles, and Cincinnati Red Stockings (AA). At the start of the 1882 season, clubs playing in the American Association had their players wear non-matching silk uniforms, with a different color and/or pattern corresponding to each position in the field. Accordingly, on opening day for the Red Stockings, Stearns wore an unusual candy-striped jersey. On September 11, 1882, Stearns was involved in a notable milestone, when pitcher Tony Mullane of the Louisville Eclipse pitched the first no-hit game in the history of the American Association against Stearns and his teammates on the Cincinnati Red Stockings, a 2-0 win by Louisville. Stearns made the game's final out by bouncing into a fielder's choice that forced runner Pop Snyder at second base. The Red Stockings had the last laugh, however, ending the year as the AA's inaugural champions. Unsatisfied with their first-base play in 1882, the Red Stockings signed Long John Reilly of the New York Metropolitans to replace Stearns prior to the 1883 season. Stearns spent the 1887 season with the Topeka Golden Giants of the Western League, leading that league in hits. That team finished with a dominant record of 90-25, and is sometimes described as the strongest minor league baseball club of the 19th century. Stearns is also notable as one of the first Jews to play Major League Baseball. His status as such made him popular with Jewish youths who were fans of the game.",

Although he is perhaps most frequently associated with Winger, Taylor has also played with numerous other prominent musicians, including future Sammy Hagar and Boston guitarist Gary Pihl (in his early days), Eric Martin (solo artist and future Mr. Big frontman), Aldo Nova, Steve Perry of Journey, Alice Cooper, and Tommy Shaw.\n\nTaylor experienced his first mainstream success in the early 1980s as the touring keyboardist in Canadian musician Aldo Nova's backing band, and he appears in the music video for Nova's biggest hit, \"Fantasy.\" Prior to forming Winger, Taylor and Kip Winger were both playing with Alice Cooper's backing band on the tours for Cooper's mid-80s albums, \"Constrictor\" (1986) and \"Raise Your Fist and Yell\" (1987). During this time, the two began composing songs together and, while on break from touring, recorded what would become the first Winger demos. Whereas Kip left Alice's band prior to the European leg of the 1987 tour, Paul remained on board for the European dates. However, in the midst of touring Europe, Paul received a call from Kip, who had been working with future Winger lead guitarist Reb Beach recording more demos in New York, informing him that he had gotten a record deal. After the European tour was finished, Paul flew straight back to New York, and the Winger project (initially known as \"Sahara\") began rehearsing and recording their debut album.\n\nTaylor remained in Winger throughout the band's most successful period, which included the two smash albums, \"Winger\" and \"In the Heart of the Young\". However, after the tour supporting the latter album ended in 1991, Taylor left the band in early 1992, citing exhaustion and a desire to write and get involved with other projects. Throughout the 1990s, Taylor immersed himself in numerous other projects, perhaps the most prolific of which was recording and touring with Steve Perry for his 1994 solo album.\n\nIn 1998, he returned to the Alice Cooper band (this time, alongside fellow former Winger guitarist Reb Beach), and once that tour ended, he embarked on a brief tour with Tommy Shaw. Winger reunited in 2001 to record new material for a \"Greatest Hits\" album. Although it is unclear whether Taylor participated in these recording sessions, he did later join the band on the supporting tour. Though Paul was asked by Kip Winger to rejoin the band again to work on their 2006 reunion album, he declined because he was already involved with other projects.\n\nMore recently, Taylor has become involved in composing music for television series programs and has also been pursuing his passion for photography. He also spent the summer months of 2012 touring with Cinderella throughout the U.S. playing keyboards for them. He returned to Winger during mid-2013 and performed with them on select tour dates up through early 2014 and appeared in the Queen Babylon released in late 2014.",

    "evidence": "Stephen George Ridzik (April 29, 1929 – January 8, 2008) was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for five teams from 1950 to 1963, primarily the Philadelphia Phillies and Washington Senators. Born in Yonkers, New York, Ridzik was signed by the Phillies at the age of 16 and made his Major League debut on September 4, 1950, pitching in relief. In 1951, Ridzik started 12 games and relieved in 30 more, going 9-6 with an earned run average of 3.77. The Phillies traded him on April 30, 1952, along with Smoky Burgess and Stan Palys, to the Cincinnati Redlegs for Andy Seminick, Glen Gorbous, and Jim Greengrass. After having his contract sold to Seattle of the Pacific Coast League that same year, the New York Giants claimed him the next month in the Rule 5 Draft. Ridzik pitched for the Giants from 1952 to 1957, appearing in 56 games including 5 starts. On April 8, 1958, the Giants sold his contract to the Cleveland Indians, where he would pitch in six more games before his contract was sold again to the Chicago Cubs. He would not pitch a Major League game with the Cubs before his contract was sold to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. Ridzik signed with the Washington Senators three years later in 1961 after developing a knuckleball. He would appear in 132 games, mostly in relief, over the next three years for the Senators. On April 13, 1964, his contract was sold back to his original team, the Phillies. He would appear in two games with the Phillies that year before calling it a career. After life as a baseball player, Ridzik worked in the Washington D.C. area for a military food distributor until moving to Florida in the late 1980s. In Florida, he helped with the organizing of charity events featuring former Major League players. He also helped establish the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association with former Senators teammate, Chuck Hinton. He died on January 8, 2008, after fighting heart disease for several years.",

    "evidence": "Tommy Nutter (17 April 1943 – 17 August 1992) was a British tailor, famous for reinventing the Savile Row suit in the 1960s. Born in Barmouth, Merioneth to Christopher Nutter and Dorothy (formerly Banister), he was raised in Edgware, Middlesex, where his father owned a local high street café. After the family moved to Kilburn, Nutter and his brother David attended Willesden Technical College. Nutter initially studied plumbing and then architecture, but he abandoned both aged 19 to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy. In the early 1960s, he joined traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward. After seven years, in 1969, he joined up with Edward Sexton to open \"Nutters of Savile Row\" at No. 35a Savile Row. They were financially backed by Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, managing director of the Beatles' Apple Corps Peter Brown, and lawyer James Vallance-White. The business was an immediate success, as Nutter combined traditional tailoring skills with innovative design. He designed for the Hardy Amies range, and then for the man himself. His clients included his investors, plus Sir Roy Strong, Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger and Elton John. Nutter himself was most proud of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles' album \"Abbey Road\" in 1969, he dressed three out of the four: George Harrison elected to be photographed on the road-crossing in denims.\n\nIn the 1970s, his bespoke business became less successful, but he branched out into ready-to-wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing the Savile Row brand in Japan. In 1976, Sexton bought Nutter out of the business. Nutter went to work for Kilgour French and Stanbury, managing his own workroom. Sexton continued to run Nutters of Savile Row until 1983, when Nutter returned to the Row with a ready-to-wear shop: \"Tommy Nutter, Savile Row\". (This new venture, which traded at No. 19 Savile Row until Tommy's death, was backed by J&J Crombie Limited, who continue to own the \"Tommy Nutter\" trademark.) At this time, Sexton set up a business in his own name. In the 1980s, he described his suits as a \"cross between the big-shouldered 'Miami Vice' look and the authentic Savile Row.\" He created the clothing of the Joker worn by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film \"Batman\". Nutter died in 1992 at the Cromwell Hospital in London of complications from AIDS.",

    "evidence": "Sir Josiah Mason (23 February 1795 - 16 June 1881) was an English industrialist, engaged in pen manufacture and other trades, and a philanthropist. He founded Mason Science College in 1875, which later became the University of Birmingham. He was the son of a carpet-weaver and was born in Mill Street, Kidderminster. He began life as a street hawker of cakes, fruits, and vegetables. After trying his hand in his native town at shoemaking, baking, carpentry, blacksmithing, house-painting, and carpet-weaving, he moved in 1816 to Birmingham. There he found employment in the gilt-toy trade. In 1824, he set up on his own account as a manufacturer of split-rings by machinery, to which he subsequently added the making of steel pens. Owing to the circumstance of his pens being supplied through James Perry, the London stationer whose name they bore, he was less well known than Joseph Gillott and other makers, although he was really the largest producer in England, contributing heavily to the Birmingham pen trade. In 1874, the business was converted into a limited liability company. Besides his steel-pen trade, Mason carried on for many years the business of electro-plating, copper-smelting, and India-rubber ring making, in conjunction with George Elkington. Mason was almost entirely self-educated, having taught himself to write when a shoemaker's apprentice, and in later life he felt his deficiencies keenly. It was this which led him in 1860 to establish his great orphanage at Erdington, near Birmingham. Upon it he expended about £300,000, and for this munificent endowment he was knighted in 1872. He had previously given a dispensary to his native town and an almshouse to Erdington. In 1880, Mason College, since incorporated in the University of Birmingham, was opened. The total value of the endowment was about £250,000.",

His personal name was Xiong Lü, ancestral name Mi (芈), and King Zhuang was his posthumous title. He became one of the Five Hegemons and attempted to wrest control of China from the King of Zhou. King Zhuang ascended the throne in 613 BC at a time when the kingdom of Chu was in disarray. For the first three years of his reign, Zhuang wasted time on excessive hunting and lavish partying. Several courtiers were anxious about the king, but none dared speak up as he had given orders that anyone who challenged his authority would be killed. When a particularly senior minister challenged him through a riddle, the king responded that he had been waiting for three years for someone from his court to show some nationalistic pride. The king made Sunshu Ao chancellor and began a series of reforms. Chu's agricultural output improved significantly during his reign, aided by Sunshu Ao's comprehensive dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir created in modern-day northern Anhui province. In 611 BC he annexed the state of Yong (庸国), a move which made Chu much stronger. After some overwhelming victories at the head of his army, King Zhuang attempted to take the place of King Ding of Zhou. He asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the nine tripod cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China at the time, but was rebuffed. In the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the state of Jin, another strong state at that time. Later he achieved hegemony amongst some other states. His progress from lazy regent to a hegemon of his time gave rise to the Chinese four-character idiom of \"Yī Mǐng Jīng Rén\" (一冥而惊人).",

As vice-president and general manager of GTR, he is credited with keeping the company from bankruptcy. In 1909, he became the president of GTR and all its consolidated lines, subsidiary railroads, and steamship companies. He was known for his philanthropy and received the Order of the Rising Sun, Third Class, from the Emperor of Japan in 1907. Hays is credited with the formation of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP), a dream he had to create a second transcontinental railroad within the borders of Canada. He is also blamed for the insolvency of both the GTR and the GTP. He died before his dream was complete as he perished at sea in the sinking of the RMS \"Titanic\". Before the ship collided with an iceberg, Hays made a statement that was prophetic of the disaster. His body was recovered and he was buried in Montreal. He was survived by his wife and four daughters.",

He was the son of Prince Honoré III by his wife, Maria Caterina Brignole, a Genoese noblewoman. After the fall of Napoleon I, he regained control of the principality thanks to a clause added by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord at the Congress of Vienna stating that, \"the Prince of Monaco should return to his estates\", and passed on his titles to his eldest son, Honoré V, Prince of Monaco. Honoré IV married Louise Félicité Victoire d'Aumont, Duchess of Aumont, Duchess Mazarin and of La Meilleraye on 15 July 1777 in Paris. They divorced in 1798. They had two sons: Honoré V (1778 – 1841) and Florestan I (1785 – 1856). During the French occupation of Monaco, Honoré IV was imprisoned for several years. Illnesses resulting from this imprisonment incapacitated Honoré IV in his later years, and following the re-establishment of the principality a regency was established to rule in Honoré's name.",

They have been categorized by some reviewers as a math rock group and compared to groups such as Don Caballero, Sunny Day Real Estate, and Pinback. However, as the band moved from a five-piece to a two-piece, their sound moved away from the angular sound of previous records and closer to a more melodic heavy composition structure with sing-a-long choruses. The current two-piece sound can be attributed to influences such as Dirty Projectors, Beirut, and Grizzly Bear. In an interview with Baeble Music, Ward coined the band with the term \"indie cabaret\". In 2006, producer and engineer Scott Solter (who has worked with John Vanderslice and The Mountain Goats) remixed the 2005 album Stowaway, which he had also recorded.

As the Populist Party nominee, Bryan had another running mate as well, Thomas E. Watson. Sewall never held elective office, although he was a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1888 to 1896. Sewall's main claim to fame had been as an exceptionally successful, wealthy shipbuilder and New England industrialist. He was a director of the Maine Central Railroad and president of the Bath National Bank for years. His selection is believed to have been an effort to win votes among conservative and New England members of the party who were disturbed by the populist aspects of William Jennings Bryan. Sewall is also one of the few politicians to be an adherent of Swedenborgianism, a religion based on the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg. His main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A. Hobart (Rep.), was also an Eastern banker and industrialist who had served on his party's national committee. Sewall was Bryan's running mate for the first of Bryan's three times as the Democratic presidential nominee. He died not long after Bryan was nominated for the second time in 1900.

He founded Mason Science College in 1875, which later became the University of Birmingham. He was the son of a carpet-weaver and was born in Mill Street, Kidderminster. He began life as a street hawker of cakes, fruits, and vegetables. After trying his hand in his native town at shoemaking, baking, carpentry, blacksmithing, house-painting, and carpet-weaving, he moved in 1816 to Birmingham. There he found employment in the gilt-toy trade. In 1824, he set up on his own account as a manufacturer of split-rings by machinery, to which he subsequently added the making of steel pens. Owing to the circumstance of his pens being supplied through James Perry, the London stationer whose name they bore, he was less well known than Joseph Gillott and other makers, although he was really the largest producer in England, contributing heavily to the Birmingham pen trade. In 1874, the business was converted into a limited liability company. Besides his steel-pen trade, Mason carried on for many years the business of electro-plating, copper-smelting, and India-rubber ring making, in conjunction with George Elkington. Mason was almost entirely self-educated, having taught himself to write when a shoemaker's apprentice, and in later life he felt his deficiencies keenly. It was this which led him in 1860 to establish his great orphanage at Erdington, near Birmingham. Upon it he expended about £300,000, and for this munificent endowment he was knighted in 1872. He had previously given a dispensary to his native town and an almshouse to Erdington. In 1880, Mason College, since incorporated in the University of Birmingham, was opened. The total value of the endowment was about £250,000.",

Stevens appeared in 68 of the show's 235 episodes, between 1957 and 1960. Stevens was reported to have left the show in 1960 because his family moved from Burbank to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, although Barbara Billingsley, who played \"June Cleaver\" on the series, said in a TV archive interview that Stevens was dropped because his overbearing mother caused grief for the producers of the series.\n\nAfter 1960, Stevens appeared in a handful of television episodes on other shows, including the NBC family drama \"National Velvet\". He was also cast as a schoolboy bully on an episode of ABC's \"The Rifleman\". Stevens briefly returned to the screen when he reprised his role as Larry Mondello in the 1983 made-for-television reunion movie, \"Still the Beaver\", and for three episodes of \"The New Leave It to Beaver\".",

    "evidence": "Stephen George Ridzik (April 29, 1929 – January 8, 2008) was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for five teams from 1950 to 1963, primarily the Philadelphia Phillies and Washington Senators. Born in Yonkers, New York, Ridzik was signed by the Phillies at the age of 16 and made his Major League debut on September 4, 1950, pitching in relief. In 1951, Ridzik started 12 games and relieved in 30 more, going 9-6 with an earned run average of 3.77. The Phillies traded him on April 30, 1952, along with Smoky Burgess and Stan Palys, to the Cincinnati Redlegs for Andy Seminick, Glen Gorbous, and Jim Greengrass. After having his contract sold to Seattle of the Pacific Coast League that same year, the New York Giants claimed him the next month in the Rule 5 Draft. Ridzik pitched for the Giants from 1952 to 1957, appearing in 56 games including 5 starts. On April 8, 1958, the Giants sold his contract to the Cleveland Indians, where he would pitch in six more games before his contract was sold again to the Chicago Cubs. He would not pitch a Major League game with the Cubs before his contract was sold to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. Ridzik signed with the Washington Senators three years later in 1961 after developing a knuckleball. He would appear in 132 games, mostly in relief, over the next three years for the Senators. On April 13, 1964, his contract was sold back to his original team, the Phillies. He would appear in two games with the Phillies that year before calling it a career. After life as a baseball player, Ridzik worked in the Washington D.C. area for a military food distributor until moving to Florida in the late 1980s. In Florida, he helped with the organizing of charity events featuring former Major League players. He also helped establish the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association with former Senators teammate, Chuck Hinton. He died on January 8, 2008, after fighting heart disease for several years.",

    "evidence": "C.V. Ananda Bose is an Indian civil servant who served in the Indian Administrative Service. He is notable for not yielding to the corrupt system of the Indian bureaucracy. An eminent administrator, writer, orator, and innovator, Dr. C.V. Ananda Bose pioneered pathbreaking administrative innovations in rural development, affordable housing, eco-tourism development, redressal of public grievances, women's empowerment, development of weaker sections of society, and promotion of art and culture. The innovations have found expression in various developmental programmes that have been executed at the district, state, and national levels in India.\n\nIt was in the area of low-cost housing that Dr. Bose pioneered a movement that won international acclaim. He set up the first Nirmithi Kendra (building centre) in the country in the Kollam district, which became the institutional mechanism for the propagation of cost-effective, environment-friendly (CEEF) building technology. This was positively evaluated by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Government of India (1993). Based on the Kollam model, the Government of India launched the National Building Centre Movement to replicate Nirmithi Kendras (building centres) in every district of the country. The Nirmithi Movement was adjudged by the United Nations as one of the global best practices in the field of sustainable human settlement development.\n\nEarly in his career, Dr. Bose introduced the \"Gramotsava\" programme in Kerala, wherein the local people were encouraged to actively participate in the village development planning. The initiative, launched in the Kasargode district of Kerala in the 1980s, was subsequently implemented in 200 panchayats across the state. Dr. Bose also founded the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in the Kollam district during his tenure as Collector. The Council generated high tourism interest in the region and created new job opportunities for the local people. The Government of Kerala subsequently set up similar councils in all 14 districts of the state. DTPs have made perceptible contributions in positioning Kerala as \"God's own country\".\n\nHe later pioneered an eco-village programme in the Mannanan village of the Kottayam district of Kerala, wherein the family clusters were encouraged to pursue activities such as organic farming, soil and water conservation through traditional methods, floriculture, horticulture, vermiculture, generation of energy from non-conventional sources, homestead forestry, etc., with institutional support, governmental assistance, and financial support from different agencies.\n\nAs Chairman of the Atomic Energy Education Society, Mumbai, Dr. Bose introduced and reinforced the concept of alternative education, wherein people could pursue studies in disciplines in which they did not have prior academic backgrounds. He founded the Institute of Alternative Education. He also launched the ASTER Project (Application of Science & Technology in Educational Reforms) which sought to alter the mode of academic delivery through the application of information and communication technology (ICT).\n\nAs Managing Director of NAFED, Dr. Bose initiated a few innovative programmes which helped control the price spiral during 2009-10. Christened as \"Farm Gate to Home Gate\", this innovation sought to buy agricultural produce directly from the farmers for distribution among the consumers, taking only marginal profit. Spurred by the success of this pilot programme in New Delhi, the Easy Market Scheme was envisaged for price control in the rest of the country.\n\nAs the administrator of the National Museum, Dr. Bose launched a 100-day programme which spelt out specific measures to revamp and revitalise the institution. Most of the improvements suggested were achieved in 60 days, such as opening the closed-down galleries, modernising the display and lighting, launching outreach programmes to take the museum to the community, arranging children's programmes to ignite young minds to the greatness of India's national heritage, organising international exhibitions, and launching the People's Museum Movement, to mention a few.\n\nPursuit of excellence was always central to Dr. Bose's role in public administration. His contributions were seldom circumscribed by the call of duty. Instead, he has been engaged in continuous research and field experimentation in developing the most appropriate, people-first solutions. He also took key steps to synergise the various government programmes and schemes to create comprehensive, sustainable, and inclusive administrative mechanisms that have since been replicated in multiple domains.\n\nIn recognition of this remarkable turnaround of the museum management and the perceptible makeover of the institution, the Government of India asked Dr. Bose to continue with this mission even after his retirement from service.",

On 9 November 1918, he was awarded the \"Légion d'Honneur\" to accompany his prior awards of the \"Croix de Guerre\" with five \"palmes\", one \"étoile de vermeil\", one \"étoile d'argent\", and another \"étoile de bronze\".

He was one of the captains who sent a letter to Prince William of Orange, who had just landed at Torbay, assuring the Prince of the captains' support; the Prince's response ultimately led to the Royal Navy switching allegiance to the Prince and the Glorious Revolution of November 1688. Aylmer saw action at the Battle of Bantry Bay in May 1689, at the Battle of Beachy Head in July 1690, and again at the Battle of Barfleur in May 1692 during the Nine Years' War. Aylmer became Commander-in-Chief of the Navy on 12 November 1709. However, when Aylmer met a French squadron and convoy, he was only able to capture one merchantman and the 56-gun \"Superbe\": the new Harley ministry used this failure as an excuse to remove him as Commander-in-Chief and did so a few months later. Following the accession of George I and the appointment of the Townshend ministry, Aylmer was reappointed Commander-in-Chief on 5 November 1714. He was also appointed Governor of Greenwich Hospital: in this post he founded the Royal Hospital School for the sons of seamen.",

Her younger sister, Bridgette Caquatto, was also an elite gymnast on the senior US National Team. She first qualified as an elite gymnast in 2007 and competed at the 2007 US National Championships, where she finished 17th. Mackenzie competed as a senior for the first time at the 2008 US National Championships and placed 10th overall. She was selected to be a member of her first national team and qualified for the 2008 US Olympic Team Trials, but competed only on the first day of competition, placing 12th in the all-around on that day.\n\nIn 2009, Caquatto competed at her first international meets as a member of the national team. Caquatto suffered a knee injury shortly after, but managed to place 5th at the 2009 US National Championships. She was then invited to the World Championships Selection Camp and was named as the first alternate for the team. In addition to her status as an alternate, she was sent to the Toyota International in Toyota City, Japan. At this competition, she competed on the uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise, winning the silver medal on the uneven bars with a score of 14.675, only behind world silver medalist on the event, Koko Tsurumi of Japan.\n\nCaquatto started her 2010 season by competing at the City of Jesolo Trophy, where she had the highest beam score but made mistakes on the floor which kept her from medaling in the all-around. Caquatto competed at the 2010 CoverGirl Classic and placed 3rd in the all-around, scoring the second highest on vault and the uneven bars but falling from the balance beam. She had qualified to compete at the 2010 US National Championships. At the 2010 US National Championships, Mackenzie placed 5th in the all-around. She fell on a simple change grip skill on the uneven bars, her best event, placing 4th. After the US Nationals, Mackenzie was selected to attend a selection camp for the 2010 World Championships. From there, she advanced to the second camp where she won the all-around competition. She was eventually selected to compete.\n\nAt the World Championships, Mackenzie competed in the all-around in the qualifying round. After hitting all her routines without major error, she placed 9th individually and 3rd with the team. Although the top 24 qualifiers advance to the individual all-around final, she was left out because fellow American athletes Aly Raisman and Rebecca Bross had qualified ahead of her and only two athletes from each country can qualify to a final. After the qualifying round, Mackenzie was selected to compete on the uneven bars and the vault during the team finals. She contributed a 14.666 on the bars and a 15.000 on the vault to help the team win the silver medal behind Russia and ahead of China.\n\nShe competed as a Florida Gator at the NCAA level for the 2010–2011 season, where she became injured but still competed in the all-around for her team at the NCAA Championships. After finishing the NCAA season, Mackenzie decided to train for a comeback to elite gymnastics for the 2011 season. Mackenzie began her 2011 elite season by competing at the CoverGirl Classic. At the classic, she competed a slightly watered down balance beam routine and a solid uneven bars routine, scoring 14.100 and 14.750, respectively.\n\nAt the 2011 US Visa National Championships, Mackenzie surprised many by competing in the all-around. On day 1 of the competition, Mackenzie was in second place after the two rotations; after scoring a 14.700 and 15.000 on vault and uneven bars, respectively. Unfortunately, she counted her first fall on the balance beam. After having a solid floor exercise, she finished her night in sixth place with an all-around score of 56.000. On the final day of competition, Mackenzie competed solidly on all her events. Taking advantage of injuries to defending national champion Rebecca Bross and Chellsie Memmel, Mackenzie went on to finish the championships in fourth place behind Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, and champion Jordyn Wieber. She also took second place on the uneven bars just behind Wieber by 0.050.\n\nMackenzie was given a spot on her fourth national team and was invited to compete at the first World Team Selection Camp. She was considered to be a likely pick for the World Team, but injured her ankles when dismounting the beam at the selection camp and therefore lost her chance of going to Tokyo. After sitting out the beginning of the NCAA season, she competed on the uneven bars in early 2012 and is expected to reintroduce her beam routine soon.",

She was asked to be part of the band by Allison Robertson, and agreed even though she did not have any experience. The band rehearsed every day in her garage. Before the release of The Donnas' album \"Gold Medal\", Castellano developed tendonitis. In October 2003, she had surgery for it. During her recovery, she had to take drum lessons to re-learn to hold drumsticks the correct way. For \"Gold Medal\", she recorded with her recovering wrists, but could only play for short periods of time. A shoulder problem forced Castellano to withdraw from The Donnas' tour following a show on December 27, 2008, at the House of Blues in Anaheim, CA. Amy Cesari of the band The Demonics filled in on future tour dates. On July 9, 2010, Castellano announced on the band's website that due to her shoulder she would have to retire from drumming and performing with The Donnas. Castellano still attended events the band was involved with as well as promoted the last album she recorded with the band, \"Greatest Hits Volume 16\".

    "evidence": "C.V. Ananda Bose is an Indian civil servant who served in the Indian Administrative Service. He is notable for not yielding to the corrupt system of the Indian bureaucracy. An eminent administrator, writer, orator, and innovator, Dr. C.V. Ananda Bose pioneered pathbreaking administrative innovations in rural development, affordable housing, eco-tourism development, redressal of public grievances, women's empowerment, development of weaker sections of society, and promotion of art and culture. The innovations have found expression in various developmental programmes that have been executed at the district, state, and national levels in India.\n\nIt was in the area of low-cost housing that Dr. Bose pioneered a movement that won international acclaim. He set up the first Nirmithi Kendra (building centre) in the country in the Kollam district, which became the institutional mechanism for the propagation of cost-effective, environment-friendly (CEEF) building technology. This was positively evaluated by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Government of India (1993). Based on the Kollam model, the Government of India launched the National Building Centre Movement to replicate Nirmithi Kendras (building centres) in every district of the country. The Nirmithi Movement was adjudged by the United Nations as one of the global best practices in the field of sustainable human settlement development.\n\nEarly in his career, Dr. Bose introduced the \"Gramotsava\" programme in Kerala, wherein the local people were encouraged to actively participate in the village development planning. The initiative, launched in the Kasargode district of Kerala in the 1980s, was subsequently implemented in 200 panchayats across the state. Dr. Bose also founded the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in the Kollam district during his tenure as Collector. The Council generated high tourism interest in the region and created new job opportunities for the local people. The Government of Kerala subsequently set up similar councils in all 14 districts of the state. DTPs have made perceptible contributions in positioning Kerala as \"God's own country\".\n\nHe later pioneered an eco-village programme in the Mannanan village of the Kottayam district of Kerala, wherein the family clusters were encouraged to pursue activities such as organic farming, soil and water conservation through traditional methods, floriculture, horticulture, vermiculture, generation of energy from non-conventional sources, homestead forestry, etc., with institutional support, governmental assistance, and financial support from different agencies.\n\nAs Chairman of the Atomic Energy Education Society, Mumbai, Dr. Bose introduced and reinforced the concept of alternative education, wherein people could pursue studies in disciplines in which they did not have prior academic backgrounds. He founded the Institute of Alternative Education. He also launched the ASTER Project (Application of Science & Technology in Educational Reforms) which sought to alter the mode of academic delivery through the application of information and communication technology (ICT).\n\nAs Managing Director of NAFED, Dr. Bose initiated a few innovative programmes which helped control the price spiral during 2009-10. Christened as \"Farm Gate to Home Gate\", this innovation sought to buy agricultural produce directly from the farmers for distribution among the consumers, taking only marginal profit. Spurred by the success of this pilot programme in New Delhi, the Easy Market Scheme was envisaged for price control in the rest of the country.\n\nAs the administrator of the National Museum, Dr. Bose launched a 100-day programme which spelt out specific measures to revamp and revitalise the institution. Most of the improvements suggested were achieved in 60 days, such as opening the closed-down galleries, modernising the display and lighting, launching outreach programmes to take the museum to the community, arranging children's programmes to ignite young minds to the greatness of India's national heritage, organising international exhibitions, and launching the People's Museum Movement, to mention a few.\n\nPursuit of excellence was always central to Dr. Bose's role in public administration. His contributions were seldom circumscribed by the call of duty. Instead, he has been engaged in continuous research and field experimentation in developing the most appropriate, people-first solutions. He also took key steps to synergise the various government programmes and schemes to create comprehensive, sustainable, and inclusive administrative mechanisms that have since been replicated in multiple domains.\n\nIn recognition of this remarkable turnaround of the museum management and the perceptible makeover of the institution, the Government of India asked Dr. Bose to continue with this mission even after his retirement from service.",

His reputation spread quickly and the monks at Sera Monastery also recognized him as their abbot. According to Sumpa Khenpo, the great Gelug scholar, he also studied some Nyingmapa tantric doctrines. When one of Tibet's kings, who had been supported by the Kagyupa, died in 1564, Sonam Gyatso presided over his funeral.

    "evidence": "Paul Taylor (born June 4, 1960, San Francisco, California), formerly credited as Paul Horowitz, is an American musician, who is best known as the keyboardist/guitarist with the late 1980s and early 1990s rock band, Winger (1987--1992, 2001--2003, 2013--2014). Although he is perhaps most frequently associated with Winger, Taylor has also played with numerous other prominent musicians, including future Sammy Hagar and Boston guitarist Gary Pihl (in his early days), Eric Martin (solo artist and future Mr. Big frontman), Aldo Nova, Steve Perry of Journey, Alice Cooper, and Tommy Shaw.\n\nTaylor experienced his first mainstream success in the early 1980s as the touring keyboardist in Canadian musician Aldo Nova's backing band, and he appears in the music video for Nova's biggest hit, \"Fantasy.\" Prior to forming Winger, Taylor and Kip Winger were both playing with Alice Cooper's backing band on the tours for Cooper's mid-80s albums, \"Constrictor\" (1986) and \"Raise Your Fist and Yell\" (1987). During this time, the two began composing songs together and, while on break from touring, recorded what would become the first Winger demos. Whereas Kip left Alice's band prior to the European leg of the 1987 tour, Paul remained on board for the European dates. However, in the midst of touring Europe, Paul received a call from Kip, who had been working with future Winger lead guitarist Reb Beach recording more demos in New York, informing him that he had gotten a record deal. After the European tour was finished, Paul flew straight back to New York, and the Winger project (initially known as \"Sahara\") began rehearsing and recording their debut album.\n\nTaylor remained in Winger throughout the band's most successful period, which included the two smash albums, \"Winger\" and \"In the Heart of the Young\". However, after the tour supporting the latter album ended in 1991, Taylor left the band in early 1992, citing exhaustion and a desire to write and get involved with other projects. Throughout the 1990s, Taylor immersed himself in numerous other projects, perhaps the most prolific of which was recording and touring with Steve Perry for his 1994 solo album.\n\nIn 1998, he returned to the Alice Cooper band (this time, alongside fellow former Winger guitarist Reb Beach), and once that tour ended, he embarked on a brief tour with Tommy Shaw. Winger reunited in 2001 to record new material for a \"Greatest Hits\" album. Although it is unclear whether Taylor participated in these recording sessions, he did later join the band on the supporting tour. Though Paul was asked by Kip Winger to rejoin the band again to work on their 2006 reunion album, he declined because he was already involved with other projects.\n\nMore recently, Taylor has become involved in composing music for television series programs and has also been pursuing his passion for photography. He also spent the summer months of 2012 touring with Cinderella throughout the U.S. playing keyboards for them. He returned to Winger during mid-2013 and performed with them on select tour dates up through early 2014 and appeared in the Queen Babylon released in late 2014.",

She was born in Trier, Germany, where her father was stationed. Yvonne de Gaulle was struck by an automobile shortly before Anne's birth. She was born with Down syndrome and lived with her family until her death. De Gaulle's relatives all testified that the general, who was normally undemonstrative in his affections for his family, was more open and extroverted with Anne. He would entertain her with songs, dances, and pantomimes. In October 1945, Yvonne de Gaulle bought the Château de Vert-Cœur at Milon-la-Chapelle (Yvelines), where they installed a private hospital for handicapped young girls: the \"Fondation Anne de Gaulle\". Anne died of pneumonia on 6 February 1948, aged 20, at Colombey-les-Deux-Églises. Upon her death, her father said: \"Now, she's like the others.\" (\"Maintenant, elle est comme les autres.\") On 22 August 1962, Charles de Gaulle was the victim of an attempted assassination at Petit-Clamart. He later said that the potentially fatal bullet had been stopped by the frame of the photograph of Anne that he always carried with him, placed this particular day on the rear shelf of his car. When he died in 1970, he was buried in the cemetery of Colombey beside his beloved daughter.",

    "evidence": "Heinz Christian Pander (24 July 1794 – 22 September 1865), also known as Christian Heinrich Pander, was a Baltic German biologist and embryologist born in Riga. In 1817, he received his doctorate from the University of Würzburg, and spent several years (1827–1842) performing scientific research from his estate in Carnikava (on the banks of the Gauja River near Riga). In 1820, he took part in a scientific expedition to Bokhara as a naturalist. In 1826, he became a member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Pander studied the chick embryo and discovered the germ layers (i.e., three distinct regions of the embryo that give rise to the specific organ system). Because of these findings, he is considered by many to be the \"founder of embryology\". His work in embryology was continued by Karl Ernst von Baer (1792–1876), who expanded Pander's concept of germ layers to include all vertebrates. Pander performed important studies in the field of paleontology, being known for his extensive research on fossils found in the Devonian and Silurian geological strata of the Baltic regions. His study of trilobites from this age led to the adjective \"Panderian\", first used by the Canadian palaeontologist Elkanah Billings. Pander is credited as the first scientist to describe primitive creatures known as conodonts. Today, the Pander Society is an international association of palaeontologists and stratigraphers with a common interest in the study of conodonts. He died in Saint Petersburg.",

    "evidence": "Adamu ɓii Ardo Hassana (c. 1771 – c. 1848), more commonly known as Modibo Adamu, was a Fulani scholar and holy warrior who hailed from the Ba'en clan of Fulbe. He led a jihad into the region of Fumbina (in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria), opening the region for Fulani colonisation. As a result of Adamu's constant warring, the Fulani today make up the largest ethnic group in northern Cameroon (at more than 60% of the region's entire population, which, considering the fact that they weren't from the area, is a remarkable feat), and Islam is the dominant religion. The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region. Adamu studied in Hausaland and earned the title \"Modibo\" (\"Lettered One\") for his scholarship. Upon finishing his studies, he returned home to Gurin and learned of the jihad declared by Fulani mystic Usman dan Fodio. When he accompanied a delegation to visit Usman, the leader ordered Adamu to extend his jihad east as \"Lamido Fumbina\" (Ruler of the Southlands). Adamu raised an army and attacked Bata settlements near Gurin. He took the villages, and many more traditional Fulbe leaders and new soldiers came to his side. He next took on Mandara, the largest and best organised state in the region. He swept over several smaller settlements and eventually conquered the Mandara capital, Dulo, with ease. While his men celebrated, however, the Mandara army counterattacked and recaptured the town. Though he fought many more campaigns, Adamu now spent most of his time in Yola, which became his capital. He set about creating the administrative structure of his new state, which he named Adamawa after himself. Adamu ruled the empire, subordinate only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. Below him lay the heads of major settlements, known as Lamibe (singular: Lamido). The village formed the smallest unit of government. Upon Adamu's death in 1847, his son Muhammadu Lawal became Lamido of Adamawa. The empire was not to last, however, as colonial battles and division eventually destroyed the independent Fulani state. The conquest had long-term repercussions, however. The Fulani became the dominant ethnic group in the region, and Islam the major religion. The herdsmen altered the land to be more suitable for herding cattle, their primary pursuit. The jihad also pushed those peoples who had lived on the Adamawa Plateau south into the forest, the single most important event in the populating of southern Cameroon.",

    "evidence": "Royce Campbell is a jazz guitarist primarily associated with mainstream jazz, but he has also released smooth jazz and post-bop jazz recordings. He was born in Seymour, Indiana, in 1952. The son of a career Navy man, Campbell grew up in various cities around the U.S. and abroad, including Asia, Europe, and the West Indies. Exposure to various musical genres while a child contributed to Campbell's musical style and approach in jazz composition and playing. A love for rock and roll marked Campbell's first connection with the guitar, at the age of nine, when he discovered Chuck Berry. Like many guitarists of his generation, Campbell was also influenced by Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. By the time Royce finished high school in the early 1970s, he was certain he wanted to pursue a professional career in music. His uncle, Carroll Decamp, an arranger/pianist who arranged for Stan Kenton and Les Elgart, invited Royce to live with him and study in Indiana, providing most of Royce's musical education in theory and composition. By age 21, Campbell had begun touring with R&B artist Marvin Gaye and developing his talents for stage performance. In 1975, Royce was hired by a local music contractor to do three concerts with award-winning film composer Henry Mancini in Indianapolis. Soon after, Royce became the touring guitarist with Henry Mancini's orchestra, holding that position until Mancini's death in 1994. While appearing on recordings as a sideman, and a couple as leader, during the early years of his career, Campbell started recording and touring more on his own during the 1990s, focusing at first on mainstream or straight-ahead jazz. Although he cites Wes Montgomery as his main influence, the influence of horn players such as Dexter Gordon and Chet Baker are evident in Royce's melodic style. In 1993, he produced Project G-5: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery, which also featured guitarists Tal Farlow, Jimmy Raney, Herb Ellis, and Cal Collins. His 1994 album 6x6 featured guitarists Pat Martino, John Abercrombie, Larry Coryell, Dave Stryker, and Bucky Pizzarelli. With Project G-5: A Tribute to Joe Pass, in 1999, he combined the talents of Charlie Byrd, Gene Bertoncini, Mundell Lowe, and John Pisano. During his career, Royce Campbell has released more than 30 CDs as leader or co-leader, among various sideman projects. Fifteen of these CDs have made it onto the US National Jazz Radio Charts. Campbell's soloing is documented among other jazz guitarists of the era, in Mel Bay's Anthology of Jazz Guitar Solos: Featuring Solos by the World's Finest Jazz Guitarists! In November 2010, Royce Campbell was inducted into the Indianapolis Jazz Foundation Hall of Fame.",

He founded Mason Science College in 1875, which later became the University of Birmingham. He was the son of a carpet-weaver and was born in Mill Street, Kidderminster. He began life as a street hawker of cakes, fruits, and vegetables. After trying his hand in his native town at shoemaking, baking, carpentry, blacksmithing, house-painting, and carpet-weaving, he moved in 1816 to Birmingham. There he found employment in the gilt-toy trade. In 1824, he set up on his own account as a manufacturer of split-rings by machinery, to which he subsequently added the making of steel pens. Owing to the circumstance of his pens being supplied through James Perry, the London stationer whose name they bore, he was less well known than Joseph Gillott and other makers, although he was really the largest producer in England, contributing heavily to the Birmingham pen trade. In 1874, the business was converted into a limited liability company. Besides his steel-pen trade, Mason carried on for many years the business of electro-plating, copper-smelting, and India-rubber ring making, in conjunction with George Elkington. Mason was almost entirely self-educated, having taught himself to write when a shoemaker's apprentice, and in later life he felt his deficiencies keenly. It was this which led him in 1860 to establish his great orphanage at Erdington, near Birmingham. Upon it he expended about £300,000, and for this munificent endowment he was knighted in 1872. He had previously given a dispensary to his native town and an almshouse to Erdington. In 1880, Mason College, since incorporated in the University of Birmingham, was opened. The total value of the endowment was about £250,000.",

A member of Alexander the Great's personal bodyguard, he went on to command the Companion Cavalry and was entrusted with many other tasks throughout Alexander's ten-year campaign in Asia, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges, and the foundation of new settlements. Besides being a soldier, engineer, and diplomat, he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate the Greeks and Persians. Alexander formally made him his second-in-command when he appointed him Chiliarch of the Empire. Alexander also made him part of the royal family when he gave him as his bride Drypetis, sister to his own second wife Stateira, both daughters of Darius III of Persia. When he died suddenly at Ecbatana around age thirty-two, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief. He petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant Hephaestion divine status, and thus Hephaestion was honored as a \"divine hero\". Hephaestion was cremated in Babylon in the presence of the entire army.

    "evidence": "Pattern is Movement (often stylized as Pattern is Movement) is an American indie rock band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that was established in 2001. They have been categorized by some reviewers as a math rock group and compared to groups such as Don Caballero, Sunny Day Real Estate, and Pinback. However, as the band moved from a five-piece to a two-piece, their sound moved away from the angular sound of previous records and closer to a more melodic heavy composition structure with sing-a-long choruses. The current two-piece sound can be attributed to influences such as Dirty Projectors, Beirut, and Grizzly Bear. In an interview with Baeble Music, Ward coined the band with the term \"indie cabaret\". In 2006, producer and engineer Scott Solter (who has worked with John Vanderslice and The Mountain Goats) remixed the 2005 album Stowaway, which he had also recorded. This remix was considered unique due to its exclusivity to analog processes. Solter is credited on the album with \"machines, razors, tape\". Since 2008, Pattern is Movement have been performing as a two-piece. On the January 2008 issue of Philadelphia Weekly, they were featured in a cover story citing \"four indie bands that can expect a big year\". The band emerged with a new album, All Together, documenting the lineup in the spring of 2008, also recorded with Solter. In his favorable review, Pitchfork Media writer Joe Tangari described it as \"an accessible album that nonetheless sounds unlike what any other band is doing\". In April 2009, they became one of Limewire's featured artists. In 2015, after releasing their self-titled fourth album, Pattern is Movement announced their farewell tour.",

    "evidence": "Paul Taylor (born June 4, 1960, San Francisco, California), formerly credited as Paul Horowitz, is an American musician, who is best known as the keyboardist/guitarist with the late 1980s and early 1990s rock band, Winger (1987--1992, 2001--2003, 2013--2014). Although he is perhaps most frequently associated with Winger, Taylor has also played with numerous other prominent musicians, including future Sammy Hagar and Boston guitarist Gary Pihl (in his early days), Eric Martin (solo artist and future Mr. Big frontman), Aldo Nova, Steve Perry of Journey, Alice Cooper, and Tommy Shaw.\n\nTaylor experienced his first mainstream success in the early 1980s as the touring keyboardist in Canadian musician Aldo Nova's backing band, and he appears in the music video for Nova's biggest hit, \"Fantasy.\" Prior to forming Winger, Taylor and Kip Winger were both playing with Alice Cooper's backing band on the tours for Cooper's mid-80s albums, \"Constrictor\" (1986) and \"Raise Your Fist and Yell\" (1987). During this time, the two began composing songs together and, while on break from touring, recorded what would become the first Winger demos. Whereas Kip left Alice's band prior to the European leg of the 1987 tour, Paul remained on board for the European dates. However, in the midst of touring Europe, Paul received a call from Kip, who had been working with future Winger lead guitarist Reb Beach recording more demos in New York, informing him that he had gotten a record deal. After the European tour was finished, Paul flew straight back to New York, and the Winger project (initially known as \"Sahara\") began rehearsing and recording their debut album.\n\nTaylor remained in Winger throughout the band's most successful period, which included the two smash albums, \"Winger\" and \"In the Heart of the Young\". However, after the tour supporting the latter album ended in 1991, Taylor left the band in early 1992, citing exhaustion and a desire to write and get involved with other projects. Throughout the 1990s, Taylor immersed himself in numerous other projects, perhaps the most prolific of which was recording and touring with Steve Perry for his 1994 solo album.\n\nIn 1998, he returned to the Alice Cooper band (this time, alongside fellow former Winger guitarist Reb Beach), and once that tour ended, he embarked on a brief tour with Tommy Shaw. Winger reunited in 2001 to record new material for a \"Greatest Hits\" album. Although it is unclear whether Taylor participated in these recording sessions, he did later join the band on the supporting tour. Though Paul was asked by Kip Winger to rejoin the band again to work on their 2006 reunion album, he declined because he was already involved with other projects.\n\nMore recently, Taylor has become involved in composing music for television series programs and has also been pursuing his passion for photography. He also spent the summer months of 2012 touring with Cinderella throughout the U.S. playing keyboards for them. He returned to Winger during mid-2013 and performed with them on select tour dates up through early 2014 and appeared in the Queen Babylon released in late 2014.",

    "evidence": "Terence Michael Alderman (born 12 June 1956 in Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia) is a former Australian cricketer who played primarily as a right-arm fast-medium bowler of limited pace but nagging accuracy and movement. He began his first-class career in 1974 with Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield and came to international prominence when he was chosen for the Australian national team to tour England in 1981. In that series, he took 42 test wickets, including nine on debut, the biggest haul in a series since Jim Laker's 46 in 1956 and the fourth-highest total of all time. Alderman's 42 wickets is the record for the most wickets taken in a series without taking 10 wickets in a match. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the Almanack's 1982 edition. He was disabled from playing for over a year by a shoulder injury sustained on 13 November 1982 when he rashly tackled an English-supporting ground invader at the WACA Ground in Perth. Alderman took part in an unofficial Australian tour of South Africa in 1985–86 and 1986–87, when that country was banned from test cricket as a Commonwealth anti-apartheid sanction. As a result, he received a 3-year ban from international cricket which disqualified him from playing in the 1985 Ashes series in England. Following his suspension, Alderman returned to the Australian side and resumed his success against England, taking 41 wickets in the 1989 Ashes series and another 16 in the 1990–91 series, his final Ashes appearance. He rarely enjoyed similar success against other countries. His final test series was against the West Indies in 1990–91, where he ended his career with 170 test wickets. He was a poor batsman, passing fifty just once in his career and averaging barely eight in first-class cricket. He had three seasons in English county cricket, with Kent (1984 and 1986) and then with Gloucestershire (1988). He now works as a courier for Mercury in Western Australia. On 28 July 2000, Alderman was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for being the all-time leading wicket taker for Western Australia. Alderman's sister Denise Emerson is married to former test umpire Ross Emerson and herself played seven tests for the Australian women's cricket team.

    "evidence": "Mackenzie Caquatto (born March 26, 1992) is an American artistic gymnast. She was formerly on the US National Team. Her younger sister, Bridgette Caquatto, was also an elite gymnast on the senior US National Team. She first qualified as an elite gymnast in 2007 and competed at the 2007 US National Championships, where she finished 17th. Mackenzie competed as a senior for the first time at the 2008 US National Championships and placed 10th overall. She was selected to be a member of her first national team and qualified for the 2008 US Olympic Team Trials, but competed only on the first day of competition, placing 12th in the all-around on that day.\n\nIn 2009, Caquatto competed at her first international meets as a member of the national team. Caquatto suffered a knee injury shortly after, but managed to place 5th at the 2009 US National Championships. She was then invited to the World Championships Selection Camp and was named as the first alternate for the team. In addition to her status as an alternate, she was sent to the Toyota International in Toyota City, Japan. At this competition, she competed on the uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise, winning the silver medal on the uneven bars with a score of 14.675, only behind world silver medalist on the event, Koko Tsurumi of Japan.\n\nCaquatto started her 2010 season by competing at the City of Jesolo Trophy, where she had the highest beam score but made mistakes on the floor which kept her from medaling in the all-around. Caquatto competed at the 2010 CoverGirl Classic and placed 3rd in the all-around, scoring the second highest on vault and the uneven bars but falling from the balance beam. She had qualified to compete at the 2010 US National Championships. At the 2010 US National Championships, Mackenzie placed 5th in the all-around. She fell on a simple change grip skill on the uneven bars, her best event, placing 4th. After the US Nationals, Mackenzie was selected to attend a selection camp for the 2010 World Championships. From there, she advanced to the second camp where she won the all-around competition. She was eventually selected to compete.\n\nAt the World Championships, Mackenzie competed in the all-around in the qualifying round. After hitting all her routines without major error, she placed 9th individually and 3rd with the team. Although the top 24 qualifiers advance to the individual all-around final, she was left out because fellow American athletes Aly Raisman and Rebecca Bross had qualified ahead of her and only two athletes from each country can qualify to a final. After the qualifying round, Mackenzie was selected to compete on the uneven bars and the vault during the team finals. She contributed a 14.666 on the bars and a 15.000 on the vault to help the team win the silver medal behind Russia and ahead of China.\n\nShe competed as a Florida Gator at the NCAA level for the 2010–2011 season, where she became injured but still competed in the all-around for her team at the NCAA Championships. After finishing the NCAA season, Mackenzie decided to train for a comeback to elite gymnastics for the 2011 season. Mackenzie began her 2011 elite season by competing at the CoverGirl Classic. At the classic, she competed a slightly watered down balance beam routine and a solid uneven bars routine, scoring 14.100 and 14.750, respectively.\n\nAt the 2011 US Visa National Championships, Mackenzie surprised many by competing in the all-around. On day 1 of the competition, Mackenzie was in second place after the two rotations; after scoring a 14.700 and 15.000 on vault and uneven bars, respectively. Unfortunately, she counted her first fall on the balance beam. After having a solid floor exercise, she finished her night in sixth place with an all-around score of 56.000. On the final day of competition, Mackenzie competed solidly on all her events. Taking advantage of injuries to defending national champion Rebecca Bross and Chellsie Memmel, Mackenzie went on to finish the championships in fourth place behind Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, and champion Jordyn Wieber. She also took second place on the uneven bars just behind Wieber by 0.050.\n\nMackenzie was given a spot on her fourth national team and was invited to compete at the first World Team Selection Camp. She was considered to be a likely pick for the World Team, but injured her ankles when dismounting the beam at the selection camp and therefore lost her chance of going to Tokyo. After sitting out the beginning of the NCAA season, she competed on the uneven bars in early 2012 and is expected to reintroduce her beam routine soon.",

In addition to providing backing vocals, Meagher sang lead on occasion, as on \"They'll Make You Cry,\" a song from the band's 1965 debut album, Introducing the Beau Brummels. Meagher appeared with the band in the 1965 science-fiction/comedy movie Village of the Giants, which was featured in a 1994 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. He remained with the band as it reduced from a quintet to a trio by 1967's critically acclaimed album Triangle. During the recording of the band's next album, 1968's Bradley's Barn, Meagher was drafted, becoming one of the few musicians from a well-known rock band to serve in the military at the height of the Vietnam War. After he was discharged two years later, Meagher played in the Black Velvet Band with former Beau Brummels bandmate Declan Mulligan. Over the next three decades, Meagher has also participated in several Beau Brummels revivals, most notably in the mid-1970s when the band released a 1975 self-titled reunion album.",

Cushnahan was educated at St Mary's Christian Brothers Grammar School and Queen's University, Belfast, and worked as a teacher before going into politics. He worked as General Secretary of the Alliance Party from 1974 until 1982 and was a member of Belfast City Council between 1977 and 1985. In 1982, he was elected to the prior Assembly for North Down and two years later he became the new leader of Alliance, succeeding Oliver Napier. During his tenure as leader, he sought to strengthen the party's links with the British Liberal Party. The Anglo Irish Agreement was signed during this period and Cushnahan faced the difficult position of giving Alliance support to it and facing the united opposition of the Unionist parties. However, when the Assembly was dissolved in 1986, Cushnahan found it financially difficult to remain in politics and so stood down as leader in 1987 to be succeeded by John Alderdice. Two years later, Cushnahan made a surprise political comeback when he moved to the Republic of Ireland and stood as a Fine Gael candidate in the 1989 election to the European Parliament, winning a seat in the Munster constituency. He was an MEP for fifteen years before retiring at the 2004 elections. Cushnahan now serves as a board member of the peace and reconciliation charity Co-operation Ireland.",

    "evidence": "Adamu ɓii Ardo Hassana (c. 1771 – c. 1848), more commonly known as Modibo Adamu, was a Fulani scholar and holy warrior who hailed from the Ba'en clan of Fulbe. He led a jihad into the region of Fumbina (in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria), opening the region for Fulani colonisation. As a result of Adamu's constant warring, the Fulani today make up the largest ethnic group in northern Cameroon (at more than 60% of the region's entire population, which, considering the fact that they weren't from the area, is a remarkable feat), and Islam is the dominant religion. The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region. Adamu studied in Hausaland and earned the title \"Modibo\" (\"Lettered One\") for his scholarship. Upon finishing his studies, he returned home to Gurin and learned of the jihad declared by Fulani mystic Usman dan Fodio. When he accompanied a delegation to visit Usman, the leader ordered Adamu to extend his jihad east as \"Lamido Fumbina\" (Ruler of the Southlands). Adamu raised an army and attacked Bata settlements near Gurin. He took the villages, and many more traditional Fulbe leaders and new soldiers came to his side. He next took on Mandara, the largest and best organised state in the region. He swept over several smaller settlements and eventually conquered the Mandara capital, Dulo, with ease. While his men celebrated, however, the Mandara army counterattacked and recaptured the town. Though he fought many more campaigns, Adamu now spent most of his time in Yola, which became his capital. He set about creating the administrative structure of his new state, which he named Adamawa after himself. Adamu ruled the empire, subordinate only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. Below him lay the heads of major settlements, known as Lamibe (singular: Lamido). The village formed the smallest unit of government. Upon Adamu's death in 1847, his son Muhammadu Lawal became Lamido of Adamawa. The empire was not to last, however, as colonial battles and division eventually destroyed the independent Fulani state. The conquest had long-term repercussions, however. The Fulani became the dominant ethnic group in the region, and Islam the major religion. The herdsmen altered the land to be more suitable for herding cattle, their primary pursuit. The jihad also pushed those peoples who had lived on the Adamawa Plateau south into the forest, the single most important event in the populating of southern Cameroon.",

    "evidence": "C.V. Ananda Bose is an Indian civil servant who served in the Indian Administrative Service. He is notable for not yielding to the corrupt system of the Indian bureaucracy. An eminent administrator, writer, orator, and innovator, Dr. C.V. Ananda Bose pioneered pathbreaking administrative innovations in rural development, affordable housing, eco-tourism development, redressal of public grievances, women's empowerment, development of weaker sections of society, and promotion of art and culture. The innovations have found expression in various developmental programmes that have been executed at the district, state, and national levels in India.\n\nIt was in the area of low-cost housing that Dr. Bose pioneered a movement that won international acclaim. He set up the first Nirmithi Kendra (building centre) in the country in the Kollam district, which became the institutional mechanism for the propagation of cost-effective, environment-friendly (CEEF) building technology. This was positively evaluated by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Government of India (1993). Based on the Kollam model, the Government of India launched the National Building Centre Movement to replicate Nirmithi Kendras (building centres) in every district of the country. The Nirmithi Movement was adjudged by the United Nations as one of the global best practices in the field of sustainable human settlement development.\n\nEarly in his career, Dr. Bose introduced the \"Gramotsava\" programme in Kerala, wherein the local people were encouraged to actively participate in the village development planning. The initiative, launched in the Kasargode district of Kerala in the 1980s, was subsequently implemented in 200 panchayats across the state. Dr. Bose also founded the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in the Kollam district during his tenure as Collector. The Council generated high tourism interest in the region and created new job opportunities for the local people. The Government of Kerala subsequently set up similar councils in all 14 districts of the state. DTPs have made perceptible contributions in positioning Kerala as \"God's own country\".\n\nHe later pioneered an eco-village programme in the Mannanan village of the Kottayam district of Kerala, wherein the family clusters were encouraged to pursue activities such as organic farming, soil and water conservation through traditional methods, floriculture, horticulture, vermiculture, generation of energy from non-conventional sources, homestead forestry, etc., with institutional support, governmental assistance, and financial support from different agencies.\n\nAs Chairman of the Atomic Energy Education Society, Mumbai, Dr. Bose introduced and reinforced the concept of alternative education, wherein people could pursue studies in disciplines in which they did not have prior academic backgrounds. He founded the Institute of Alternative Education. He also launched the ASTER Project (Application of Science & Technology in Educational Reforms) which sought to alter the mode of academic delivery through the application of information and communication technology (ICT).\n\nAs Managing Director of NAFED, Dr. Bose initiated a few innovative programmes which helped control the price spiral during 2009-10. Christened as \"Farm Gate to Home Gate\", this innovation sought to buy agricultural produce directly from the farmers for distribution among the consumers, taking only marginal profit. Spurred by the success of this pilot programme in New Delhi, the Easy Market Scheme was envisaged for price control in the rest of the country.\n\nAs the administrator of the National Museum, Dr. Bose launched a 100-day programme which spelt out specific measures to revamp and revitalise the institution. Most of the improvements suggested were achieved in 60 days, such as opening the closed-down galleries, modernising the display and lighting, launching outreach programmes to take the museum to the community, arranging children's programmes to ignite young minds to the greatness of India's national heritage, organising international exhibitions, and launching the People's Museum Movement, to mention a few.\n\nPursuit of excellence was always central to Dr. Bose's role in public administration. His contributions were seldom circumscribed by the call of duty. Instead, he has been engaged in continuous research and field experimentation in developing the most appropriate, people-first solutions. He also took key steps to synergise the various government programmes and schemes to create comprehensive, sustainable, and inclusive administrative mechanisms that have since been replicated in multiple domains.\n\nIn recognition of this remarkable turnaround of the museum management and the perceptible makeover of the institution, the Government of India asked Dr. Bose to continue with this mission even after his retirement from service.",

Kurowski batted and threw right-handed. He debuted on September 23, 1941, and played his final game on October 1, 1949. In a nine-season career, Kurowski posted a .286 batting average with 106 home runs and 529 RBI in 916 games played. Kurowski's childhood nickname came from his already white hair. A native of Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski overcame several personal problems. He overcame childhood osteomyelitis, which made him miss a part of a bone on his right forearm. Before he started his baseball career, his older brother died in a mine accident, and his father died from a heart attack during spring training in 1942. His most productive season came in 1945, when he posted career-highs in average (.310), home runs (27), RBI (104), runs (108), doubles (27), slugging percentage (.544) and on-base percentage (.420). An All-Star during five consecutive seasons (1943–47), Kurowski exceeded the 20 home run mark three times to set a major league record for a third baseman (1944–45, 1947), and hit over .300 three times (1945–47). He also led the National League three times in putouts, twice in fielding percentage, and once in double plays. In four World Series appearances, Kurowski hit .253 (21-for-83) with one home run and nine RBI in 23 games, as the Cardinals were world champions in 1942, 1944 and 1946. His only home run in the series, in 1942, off Red Ruffing, broke a 2–2 tie in the ninth inning of Game Five to clinch the title for St. Louis over the New York Yankees. He also appeared five times in the MVP ballot, in 1942 and from 1944 through 1947. In 1949, Kurowski developed arm and elbow problems and his playing career ended. After that, he coached and managed in the minor leagues for 18 years until 1972. He gained induction into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame in 1988. In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \"All-Time All-Star Argument Starter,\" consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Kurowski was the third baseman on Stein's Polish team. Kurowski died in Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania, at age 81.",

Although he is perhaps most frequently associated with Winger, Taylor has also played with numerous other prominent musicians, including future Sammy Hagar and Boston guitarist Gary Pihl (in his early days), Eric Martin (solo artist and future Mr. Big frontman), Aldo Nova, Steve Perry of Journey, Alice Cooper, and Tommy Shaw.\n\nTaylor experienced his first mainstream success in the early 1980s as the touring keyboardist in Canadian musician Aldo Nova's backing band, and he appears in the music video for Nova's biggest hit, \"Fantasy.\" Prior to forming Winger, Taylor and Kip Winger were both playing with Alice Cooper's backing band on the tours for Cooper's mid-80s albums, \"Constrictor\" (1986) and \"Raise Your Fist and Yell\" (1987). During this time, the two began composing songs together and, while on break from touring, recorded what would become the first Winger demos. Whereas Kip left Alice's band prior to the European leg of the 1987 tour, Paul remained on board for the European dates. However, in the midst of touring Europe, Paul received a call from Kip, who had been working with future Winger lead guitarist Reb Beach recording more demos in New York, informing him that he had gotten a record deal. After the European tour was finished, Paul flew straight back to New York, and the Winger project (initially known as \"Sahara\") began rehearsing and recording their debut album.\n\nTaylor remained in Winger throughout the band's most successful period, which included the two smash albums, \"Winger\" and \"In the Heart of the Young\". However, after the tour supporting the latter album ended in 1991, Taylor left the band in early 1992, citing exhaustion and a desire to write and get involved with other projects. Throughout the 1990s, Taylor immersed himself in numerous other projects, perhaps the most prolific of which was recording and touring with Steve Perry for his 1994 solo album.\n\nIn 1998, he returned to the Alice Cooper band (this time, alongside fellow former Winger guitarist Reb Beach), and once that tour ended, he embarked on a brief tour with Tommy Shaw. Winger reunited in 2001 to record new material for a \"Greatest Hits\" album. Although it is unclear whether Taylor participated in these recording sessions, he did later join the band on the supporting tour. Though Paul was asked by Kip Winger to rejoin the band again to work on their 2006 reunion album, he declined because he was already involved with other projects.\n\nMore recently, Taylor has become involved in composing music for television series programs and has also been pursuing his passion for photography. He also spent the summer months of 2012 touring with Cinderella throughout the U.S. playing keyboards for them. He returned to Winger during mid-2013 and performed with them on select tour dates up through early 2014 and appeared in the Queen Babylon released in late 2014.",

In 1817, he received his doctorate from the University of Würzburg, and spent several years (1827–1842) performing scientific research from his estate in Carnikava (on the banks of the Gauja River near Riga). In 1820, he took part in a scientific expedition to Bokhara as a naturalist. In 1826, he became a member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Pander studied the chick embryo and discovered the germ layers (i.e., three distinct regions of the embryo that give rise to the specific organ system). Because of these findings, he is considered by many to be the \"founder of embryology\". His work in embryology was continued by Karl Ernst von Baer (1792–1876), who expanded Pander's concept of germ layers to include all vertebrates. Pander performed important studies in the field of paleontology, being known for his extensive research on fossils found in the Devonian and Silurian geological strata of the Baltic regions. His study of trilobites from this age led to the adjective \"Panderian\", first used by the Canadian palaeontologist Elkanah Billings. Pander is credited as the first scientist to describe primitive creatures known as conodonts. Today, the Pander Society is an international association of palaeontologists and stratigraphers with a common interest in the study of conodonts. He died in Saint Petersburg.",

He was one of the most influential ideologues of the white nationalist movement for some 30 years before his death. A physicist by profession, he was also an author under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald of the novels The Turner Diaries and Hunter. Pierce founded the National Alliance, a major white nationalist organization, which he led for almost thirty years.\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, to a Presbyterian family of Scots-Irish and English descent, Pierce was descended from the aristocracy of the Old South, being a descendant of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. As a child, Pierce did well academically, graduating from high school in 1952. He received a baccalaureate in physics from Rice University in 1955, earned a doctorate from University of Colorado at Boulder in 1962, and became an assistant professor of physics at the Oregon State University in 1962, where he joined the anti-communist John Birch Society.\n\nIn 1965, in order to finance his political ambitions, he left his tenure at Oregon State University and became a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1966 Pierce moved to the Washington, D.C. area and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, who was assassinated in 1967, after which Pierce became co-leader of the National Youth Alliance, which split in 1974, with Pierce founding the National Alliance. Pierce intended the National Alliance to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist revolution in the United States.\n\nIn 1978, Pierce wrote, under the pseudonym \"Andrew Macdonald\", the novel The Turner Diaries, which depicts a violent revolution in the United States which leads to the overthrow of the United States federal government. In 1984, he wrote another novel, Hunter, which portrays the actions of a Vietnam veteran F-4 Phantom II pilot and Washington, D.C.-area defense department consultant who embarks on a plan to assassinate interracial couples and liberal journalists, politicians and bureaucrats in the D.C. area.\n\nIn 1985, Pierce relocated the headquarters of the National Alliance to Hillsboro, West Virginia, where he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church to receive tax exemption for his organization. Pierce spent the rest of his life in West Virginia hosting a weekly radio show, \"American Dissident Voices\", publishing the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and overseeing his publications, National Vanguard Magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. and music produced by his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce suddenly died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members and a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.

Born in Glasgow, Mackay turned professional when he joined Celtic from Maryhill Harp aged 17 in 1955. He developed rapidly, making his club debut within two years and earning the first of an eventual 14 caps for the Scottish national side four years later. However, Celtic were at this time in the shadow of rivals Rangers and he was destined not to win any honours with the Parkhead club. Celtic manager Jimmy McGrory's attempts to rejuvenate his side eventually resulted in Mackay's departure from Celtic Park after over 200 first team appearances, the fullback moving to South Glasgow side Third Lanark in November 1964. Thirds were relegated at the end of the 1964-65 season though, and Mackay was one of several players released. Mackay opted to move to Australia at this juncture, joining Melbourne Croatia of the Victorian State League. He helped the side to the state title in 1968 and several Dockerty Cup triumphs but left when Croatia were suspended following crowd disturbances in 1972. He returned to Scotland and joined junior club St Anthony's as a player-coach for two years before deciding upon a second stint in Australia. After playing for Perth Azzurri between 1974 and 1977, he coached with South Melbourne and Essendon Lions.",

He retired from the 500 cc race with a blown engine, again riding his 350, when holding third place. He won the 1935 Junior Manx Grand Prix and then joined the Norton team for the 1936 TT races. It was a winning combination as he claimed the Junior TT and finished second in the Senior TT as well as winning the 350 cc European Championship. In 1937 he went one better in the Senior and took a brilliant win and setting the first 90 mph plus lap of the Snaefell Mountain Course. After finishing third in the 1939 Senior he missed the 1947 TT due to a practice spill on a 500 cc Moto Guzzi. Turning to Velocettes in 1948, he won the Junior race, repeating this success a year later. Freddie also has the distinction of being the first ever 350 cc World Champion in 1949 when he won all five events of the inaugural campaign. Frith, alongside other riders from BSA, Ariel and Matchless works teams, served in the army during World War II at the Infantry Driving & Maintenance School stationed at Keswick, where officers and NCOs learned how to ride cross-country.

    "evidence": "George John Kurowski (April 19, 1918 – December 9, 1999) was a third baseman in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the St. Louis Cardinals (1949). Kurowski batted and threw right-handed. He debuted on September 23, 1941, and played his final game on October 1, 1949. In a nine-season career, Kurowski posted a .286 batting average with 106 home runs and 529 RBI in 916 games played. Kurowski's childhood nickname came from his already white hair. A native of Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski overcame several personal problems. He overcame childhood osteomyelitis, which made him miss a part of a bone on his right forearm. Before he started his baseball career, his older brother died in a mine accident, and his father died from a heart attack during spring training in 1942. His most productive season came in 1945, when he posted career-highs in average (.310), home runs (27), RBI (104), runs (108), doubles (27), slugging percentage (.544) and on-base percentage (.420). An All-Star during five consecutive seasons (1943–47), Kurowski exceeded the 20 home run mark three times to set a major league record for a third baseman (1944–45, 1947), and hit over .300 three times (1945–47). He also led the National League three times in putouts, twice in fielding percentage, and once in double plays. In four World Series appearances, Kurowski hit .253 (21-for-83) with one home run and nine RBI in 23 games, as the Cardinals were world champions in 1942, 1944 and 1946. His only home run in the series, in 1942, off Red Ruffing, broke a 2–2 tie in the ninth inning of Game Five to clinch the title for St. Louis over the New York Yankees. He also appeared five times in the MVP ballot, in 1942 and from 1944 through 1947. In 1949, Kurowski developed arm and elbow problems and his playing career ended. After that, he coached and managed in the minor leagues for 18 years until 1972. He gained induction into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame in 1988. In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \"All-Time All-Star Argument Starter,\" consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Kurowski was the third baseman on Stein's Polish team. Kurowski died in Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania, at age 81.",

They played their first gig in early 1999 and fired the bass player a few months later, with Ben Thomas switching from guitar to bass. By the summer of 2000, Perrier and Thomas' dissatisfaction with their drummer led to his departure, with Thomas switching from bass to drums so the band could continue as a two-piece. Winnebago Deal now consists of two Bens, Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (drums).\n\nWinnebago Deal generated strong support from many appearances at Oxford's Zodiac Club, eventually supporting Fugazi at London's Forum; this led to their first record, the \"Plata o Plomo\" EP in 2003. They were nominated for the Kerrang Award's \"Best British Newcomer\" that year. Soon after, the band signed a recording contract with Double Dragon Music, and produced their debut album \"Dead Gone\" with Jack Endino, producer of the first Nirvana album \"Bleach\". \"Dead Gone\" was released in September 2004. \"Plata o Plomo\" was reissued in Australia later that year, with an expanded track listing.\n\nThe \"two Bens\" then went on to play as Mondo Generator with Nick Oliveri, former Queens of the Stone Age bassist-vocalist. As well as playing Mondo Generator gigs, they still toured as Winnebago Deal and even supported Mondo Generator, earning them the moniker \"Winnebago Generator\" from fans. After recording tracks at Dave Grohl's Studio 606 for the next Mondo Generator album with producer Nick Raskulinecz, it was announced in July 2006 that they had left the band for \"undisclosed reasons\".

    "evidence": "Adamu ɓii Ardo Hassana (c. 1771 – c. 1848), more commonly known as Modibo Adamu, was a Fulani scholar and holy warrior who hailed from the Ba'en clan of Fulbe. He led a jihad into the region of Fumbina (in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria), opening the region for Fulani colonisation. As a result of Adamu's constant warring, the Fulani today make up the largest ethnic group in northern Cameroon (at more than 60% of the region's entire population, which, considering the fact that they weren't from the area, is a remarkable feat), and Islam is the dominant religion. The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region. Adamu studied in Hausaland and earned the title \"Modibo\" (\"Lettered One\") for his scholarship. Upon finishing his studies, he returned home to Gurin and learned of the jihad declared by Fulani mystic Usman dan Fodio. When he accompanied a delegation to visit Usman, the leader ordered Adamu to extend his jihad east as \"Lamido Fumbina\" (Ruler of the Southlands). Adamu raised an army and attacked Bata settlements near Gurin. He took the villages, and many more traditional Fulbe leaders and new soldiers came to his side. He next took on Mandara, the largest and best organised state in the region. He swept over several smaller settlements and eventually conquered the Mandara capital, Dulo, with ease. While his men celebrated, however, the Mandara army counterattacked and recaptured the town. Though he fought many more campaigns, Adamu now spent most of his time in Yola, which became his capital. He set about creating the administrative structure of his new state, which he named Adamawa after himself. Adamu ruled the empire, subordinate only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. Below him lay the heads of major settlements, known as Lamibe (singular: Lamido). The village formed the smallest unit of government. Upon Adamu's death in 1847, his son Muhammadu Lawal became Lamido of Adamawa. The empire was not to last, however, as colonial battles and division eventually destroyed the independent Fulani state. The conquest had long-term repercussions, however. The Fulani became the dominant ethnic group in the region, and Islam the major religion. The herdsmen altered the land to be more suitable for herding cattle, their primary pursuit. The jihad also pushed those peoples who had lived on the Adamawa Plateau south into the forest, the single most important event in the populating of southern Cameroon.",

    "evidence": "C.V. Ananda Bose is an Indian civil servant who served in the Indian Administrative Service. He is notable for not yielding to the corrupt system of the Indian bureaucracy. An eminent administrator, writer, orator, and innovator, Dr. C.V. Ananda Bose pioneered pathbreaking administrative innovations in rural development, affordable housing, eco-tourism development, redressal of public grievances, women's empowerment, development of weaker sections of society, and promotion of art and culture. The innovations have found expression in various developmental programmes that have been executed at the district, state, and national levels in India.\n\nIt was in the area of low-cost housing that Dr. Bose pioneered a movement that won international acclaim. He set up the first Nirmithi Kendra (building centre) in the country in the Kollam district, which became the institutional mechanism for the propagation of cost-effective, environment-friendly (CEEF) building technology. This was positively evaluated by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Government of India (1993). Based on the Kollam model, the Government of India launched the National Building Centre Movement to replicate Nirmithi Kendras (building centres) in every district of the country. The Nirmithi Movement was adjudged by the United Nations as one of the global best practices in the field of sustainable human settlement development.\n\nEarly in his career, Dr. Bose introduced the \"Gramotsava\" programme in Kerala, wherein the local people were encouraged to actively participate in the village development planning. The initiative, launched in the Kasargode district of Kerala in the 1980s, was subsequently implemented in 200 panchayats across the state. Dr. Bose also founded the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in the Kollam district during his tenure as Collector. The Council generated high tourism interest in the region and created new job opportunities for the local people. The Government of Kerala subsequently set up similar councils in all 14 districts of the state. DTPs have made perceptible contributions in positioning Kerala as \"God's own country\".\n\nHe later pioneered an eco-village programme in the Mannanan village of the Kottayam district of Kerala, wherein the family clusters were encouraged to pursue activities such as organic farming, soil and water conservation through traditional methods, floriculture, horticulture, vermiculture, generation of energy from non-conventional sources, homestead forestry, etc., with institutional support, governmental assistance, and financial support from different agencies.\n\nAs Chairman of the Atomic Energy Education Society, Mumbai, Dr. Bose introduced and reinforced the concept of alternative education, wherein people could pursue studies in disciplines in which they did not have prior academic backgrounds. He founded the Institute of Alternative Education. He also launched the ASTER Project (Application of Science & Technology in Educational Reforms) which sought to alter the mode of academic delivery through the application of information and communication technology (ICT).\n\nAs Managing Director of NAFED, Dr. Bose initiated a few innovative programmes which helped control the price spiral during 2009-10. Christened as \"Farm Gate to Home Gate\", this innovation sought to buy agricultural produce directly from the farmers for distribution among the consumers, taking only marginal profit. Spurred by the success of this pilot programme in New Delhi, the Easy Market Scheme was envisaged for price control in the rest of the country.\n\nAs the administrator of the National Museum, Dr. Bose launched a 100-day programme which spelt out specific measures to revamp and revitalise the institution. Most of the improvements suggested were achieved in 60 days, such as opening the closed-down galleries, modernising the display and lighting, launching outreach programmes to take the museum to the community, arranging children's programmes to ignite young minds to the greatness of India's national heritage, organising international exhibitions, and launching the People's Museum Movement, to mention a few.\n\nPursuit of excellence was always central to Dr. Bose's role in public administration. His contributions were seldom circumscribed by the call of duty. Instead, he has been engaged in continuous research and field experimentation in developing the most appropriate, people-first solutions. He also took key steps to synergise the various government programmes and schemes to create comprehensive, sustainable, and inclusive administrative mechanisms that have since been replicated in multiple domains.\n\nIn recognition of this remarkable turnaround of the museum management and the perceptible makeover of the institution, the Government of India asked Dr. Bose to continue with this mission even after his retirement from service.",

They have been categorized by some reviewers as a math rock group and compared to groups such as Don Caballero, Sunny Day Real Estate, and Pinback. However, as the band moved from a five-piece to a two-piece, their sound moved away from the angular sound of previous records and closer to a more melodic heavy composition structure with sing-a-long choruses. The current two-piece sound can be attributed to influences such as Dirty Projectors, Beirut, and Grizzly Bear. In an interview with Baeble Music, Ward coined the band with the term \"indie cabaret\". In 2006, producer and engineer Scott Solter (who has worked with John Vanderslice and The Mountain Goats) remixed the 2005 album Stowaway, which he had also recorded. This remix was considered unique due to its exclusivity to analog processes. Solter is credited on the album with \"machines, razors, tape\". Since 2008, Pattern is Movement have been performing as a two-piece. On the January 2008 issue of Philadelphia Weekly, they were featured in a cover story citing \"four indie bands that can expect a big year\". The band emerged with a new album, All Together, documenting the lineup in the spring of 2008, also recorded with Solter. In his favorable review, Pitchfork Media writer Joe Tangari described it as \"an accessible album that nonetheless sounds unlike what any other band is doing\". In April 2009, they became one of Limewire's featured artists. In 2015, after releasing their self-titled fourth album, Pattern is Movement announced their farewell tour.",

Nate Saint was born in 1923. When he was seven, he took his first plane ride with his brother Sam, who would eventually become a commercial pilot for American Airlines. While in the airplane, he discovered a love of flying. His family was somewhat unusual; his brothers made a sleeping patio on the roof of their home, and his dad built a roller coaster in the backyard.\n\nWhen he joined the army, he was stationed in Las Vegas, NV, but was transferred to several other locations over the years. A leg injury from a sledding accident caused him some problems while he was in the army. About a year before he was discharged, he almost died while climbing a mountain in Yosemite National Park. After that incident, he learned to live life to the fullest.\n\nIn September 1955, Nate was joined by his teammates, Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Pete Fleming, and Roger Youderian. Saint finally found a settlement of the Huaorani, also known as Aucas, while searching by air. To reach the tribe, Saint and the team lowered gifts to the Huaorani in a bucket tied to the plane. The Huaorani were widely feared by other Ecuadoreans, because they combined a desire to be left alone with a willingness to use force; they attacked and killed any intruders without provocation. Nevertheless, the tribe was excited on receiving the gifts and gave some gifts back.\n\nFinally, the missionaries decided to try to meet the Huaorani on the ground; and, on January 3, 1956, using the beach as a landing strip, they set up camp four miles from the Huaorani settlement. Their initial contact was encouraging; however, on Sunday, January 8, 1956, the entire team was killed on the beach (known as \"Palm Beach\") when armed Huaorani met and speared them.\n\nSaint and the other four men became famous worldwide as a result. \"Life\" magazine published a 10-page photo essay on the story, which was also covered in Reader's Digest and many other publications. Today, a small school for missionary children in Shell, Ecuador, bears Nate Saint's name. Rachel Saint, Nate's sister, continued the mission efforts to the Huaorani, which eventually came to fruition. This resulted in many of these natives becoming Christians, including those who had killed Saint.\n\nIn 1966, Marjorie (Marj) Farris Saint married Abe Van Der Puy, president of HCJB World Radio. Abe died in 2003; and Marj died in 2004, from cancer. She is buried in Hillcrest Memorial Gardens, south of Ocala, Florida. Nate's older son, Steve Saint, spent time as a child visiting his missionary family members and friends and getting to know the Huaorani. Steve was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ by Mincaye, who was the very man who killed his father but later converted to Christ. Steve Saint now works with the Huaorani people and travels around the world, preaching the gospel, often accompanied by Mincaye.\n\nA documentary based on the story, \"Through the Gates of Splendor\", was released in 2005. The following year, a feature film, \"End of the Spear\", was released on January 20, a week and a half after the 50-year anniversary of the killings. Steve Saint also helped write \"Jungle Pilot\", based on his father's diary about his time in Ecuador and work with the Huaorani Indians.",

Harriot was the first person to make a drawing of the Moon through a telescope, on 26 July 1609, over four months before Galileo. After graduating from St Mary Hall, Oxford, Harriot travelled to the Americas, accompanying the 1585 expedition to Roanoke Island funded by Sir Walter Raleigh and led by Sir Ralph Lane. Harriot was a vital member of the venture, having translated and learned the Carolina Algonquian language from two Native Americans, Wanchese and Manteo. On his return to England, he worked for the 9th Earl of Northumberland. At the Earl's house, he became a prolific mathematician and astronomer to whom the theory of refraction is attributed.",

    "evidence": "Daniel Eckford Stearns (born October 17, 1861 in Buffalo, New York - June 28, 1944 in Glendale, California), commonly known as \"Ecky\" Stearns, was a Major League Baseball first baseman. He played for the Buffalo Bisons, Detroit Wolverines, Kansas City Cowboys, Baltimore Orioles, and Cincinnati Red Stockings (AA). At the start of the 1882 season, clubs playing in the American Association had their players wear non-matching silk uniforms, with a different color and/or pattern corresponding to each position in the field. Accordingly, on opening day for the Red Stockings, Stearns wore an unusual candy-striped jersey. On September 11, 1882, Stearns was involved in a notable milestone, when pitcher Tony Mullane of the Louisville Eclipse pitched the first no-hit game in the history of the American Association against Stearns and his teammates on the Cincinnati Red Stockings, a 2-0 win by Louisville. Stearns made the game's final out by bouncing into a fielder's choice that forced runner Pop Snyder at second base. The Red Stockings had the last laugh, however, ending the year as the AA's inaugural champions. Unsatisfied with their first-base play in 1882, the Red Stockings signed Long John Reilly of the New York Metropolitans to replace Stearns prior to the 1883 season. Stearns spent the 1887 season with the Topeka Golden Giants of the Western League, leading that league in hits. That team finished with a dominant record of 90-25, and is sometimes described as the strongest minor league baseball club of the 19th century. Stearns is also notable as one of the first Jews to play Major League Baseball. His status as such made him popular with Jewish youths who were fans of the game.",

    "evidence": "Robert Holgate (1481/1482–1555) was Bishop of Llandaff and then Archbishop of York (from 1545 to 1554). He recognised Henry VIII as head of the Church of England. Although a protégé of Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, Holgate had a career in the Gilbertine Order of which he became Master. Most of the Gilbertine houses were lesser establishments which should have been dissolved under the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535 (only four out of twenty-six houses had revenues over £200 a year). However, Holgate is credited with using his influence to save them for a few years. For example, Malton Priory, one of the lesser Gilbertine houses, was the last of them to surrender in December 1539, whereas Sempringham Priory, worth more than £200 a year, surrendered in 1538.\n\nIn 1550 Holgate married Barbara Wentworth, who was about 25 at the time. This may, however, have been a second marriage to make it fully legal, and Holgate and Wentworth may have first married in late 1547 with Roger Tongue officiating. In 1551 Arthur Norman claimed that he was already married to Barbara Wentworth, but the courts decided that their marriage when she was about seven had not been a binding legal transaction. Robert and Barbara remained married until 1553, when shortly after Mary I of England came to the throne she imprisoned Holgate on various charges, with his being a married clergy being central to these. In 1554 Holgate renounced his marriage claiming he had only entered it to avoid suspicion as a papist.\n\nIn January 1555 Holgate was released from prison, but he was not restored to priestly office. He died later that year. In 1558 a Robert Holgate from Yorkshire entered the University of Cambridge. He may have been a son of Holgate, since there are some claims he had two children by Barbara, but there is no conclusive evidence on the matter.",

Mahler started on Opening Day for the Braves in 1982, when Atlanta won the National League West title. He made four straight Opening Day starts beginning in 1985. In 1987, he tied an NL record with his third Opening Day shutout. His best season came in 1985, when he went 17-15 with a 3.48 ERA. \n\nHe pitched twice in the postseason, with the Braves in 1982, and with the 1990 World Series champion Cincinnati Reds. Mahler was a key member of that Reds' pitching staff as a spot starter and reliever, going 7-6 and contributing four saves. He also appeared in ten games with the Montreal Expos in 1991 before returning to Atlanta in mid-season. \n\nAfter retiring, Mahler served as a minor league pitching coach for the Kansas City Royals and the Florida Marlins, and he was a roving instructor for the St. Louis Cardinals. He also managed St. Louis' Double-A affiliate in the Texas League from 1996 to 1997. Mahler died at age 51 of a heart attack at home in Jupiter, Florida, where he was preparing for his second season as a minor league pitching coach for the New York Mets.

    "evidence": "Robert Holgate (1481/1482–1555) was Bishop of Llandaff and then Archbishop of York (from 1545 to 1554). He recognised Henry VIII as head of the Church of England. Although a protégé of Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, Holgate had a career in the Gilbertine Order of which he became Master. Most of the Gilbertine houses were lesser establishments which should have been dissolved under the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535 (only four out of twenty-six houses had revenues over £200 a year). However, Holgate is credited with using his influence to save them for a few years. For example, Malton Priory, one of the lesser Gilbertine houses, was the last of them to surrender in December 1539, whereas Sempringham Priory, worth more than £200 a year, surrendered in 1538.\n\nIn 1550 Holgate married Barbara Wentworth, who was about 25 at the time. This may, however, have been a second marriage to make it fully legal, and Holgate and Wentworth may have first married in late 1547 with Roger Tongue officiating. In 1551 Arthur Norman claimed that he was already married to Barbara Wentworth, but the courts decided that their marriage when she was about seven had not been a binding legal transaction. Robert and Barbara remained married until 1553, when shortly after Mary I of England came to the throne she imprisoned Holgate on various charges, with his being a married clergy being central to these. In 1554 Holgate renounced his marriage claiming he had only entered it to avoid suspicion as a papist.\n\nIn January 1555 Holgate was released from prison, but he was not restored to priestly office. He died later that year. In 1558 a Robert Holgate from Yorkshire entered the University of Cambridge. He may have been a son of Holgate, since there are some claims he had two children by Barbara, but there is no conclusive evidence on the matter.",

    "evidence": "Mackenzie Caquatto (born March 26, 1992) is an American artistic gymnast. She was formerly on the US National Team. Her younger sister, Bridgette Caquatto, was also an elite gymnast on the senior US National Team. She first qualified as an elite gymnast in 2007 and competed at the 2007 US National Championships, where she finished 17th. Mackenzie competed as a senior for the first time at the 2008 US National Championships and placed 10th overall. She was selected to be a member of her first national team and qualified for the 2008 US Olympic Team Trials, but competed only on the first day of competition, placing 12th in the all-around on that day.\n\nIn 2009, Caquatto competed at her first international meets as a member of the national team. Caquatto suffered a knee injury shortly after, but managed to place 5th at the 2009 US National Championships. She was then invited to the World Championships Selection Camp and was named as the first alternate for the team. In addition to her status as an alternate, she was sent to the Toyota International in Toyota City, Japan. At this competition, she competed on the uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise, winning the silver medal on the uneven bars with a score of 14.675, only behind world silver medalist on the event, Koko Tsurumi of Japan.\n\nCaquatto started her 2010 season by competing at the City of Jesolo Trophy, where she had the highest beam score but made mistakes on the floor which kept her from medaling in the all-around. Caquatto competed at the 2010 CoverGirl Classic and placed 3rd in the all-around, scoring the second highest on vault and the uneven bars but falling from the balance beam. She had qualified to compete at the 2010 US National Championships. At the 2010 US National Championships, Mackenzie placed 5th in the all-around. She fell on a simple change grip skill on the uneven bars, her best event, placing 4th. After the US Nationals, Mackenzie was selected to attend a selection camp for the 2010 World Championships. From there, she advanced to the second camp where she won the all-around competition. She was eventually selected to compete.\n\nAt the World Championships, Mackenzie competed in the all-around in the qualifying round. After hitting all her routines without major error, she placed 9th individually and 3rd with the team. Although the top 24 qualifiers advance to the individual all-around final, she was left out because fellow American athletes Aly Raisman and Rebecca Bross had qualified ahead of her and only two athletes from each country can qualify to a final. After the qualifying round, Mackenzie was selected to compete on the uneven bars and the vault during the team finals. She contributed a 14.666 on the bars and a 15.000 on the vault to help the team win the silver medal behind Russia and ahead of China.\n\nShe competed as a Florida Gator at the NCAA level for the 2010–2011 season, where she became injured but still competed in the all-around for her team at the NCAA Championships. After finishing the NCAA season, Mackenzie decided to train for a comeback to elite gymnastics for the 2011 season. Mackenzie began her 2011 elite season by competing at the CoverGirl Classic. At the classic, she competed a slightly watered down balance beam routine and a solid uneven bars routine, scoring 14.100 and 14.750, respectively.\n\nAt the 2011 US Visa National Championships, Mackenzie surprised many by competing in the all-around. On day 1 of the competition, Mackenzie was in second place after the two rotations; after scoring a 14.700 and 15.000 on vault and uneven bars, respectively. Unfortunately, she counted her first fall on the balance beam. After having a solid floor exercise, she finished her night in sixth place with an all-around score of 56.000. On the final day of competition, Mackenzie competed solidly on all her events. Taking advantage of injuries to defending national champion Rebecca Bross and Chellsie Memmel, Mackenzie went on to finish the championships in fourth place behind Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, and champion Jordyn Wieber. She also took second place on the uneven bars just behind Wieber by 0.050.\n\nMackenzie was given a spot on her fourth national team and was invited to compete at the first World Team Selection Camp. She was considered to be a likely pick for the World Team, but injured her ankles when dismounting the beam at the selection camp and therefore lost her chance of going to Tokyo. After sitting out the beginning of the NCAA season, she competed on the uneven bars in early 2012 and is expected to reintroduce her beam routine soon.",

Assisted by some two dozen other Żegota members, Sendler smuggled approximately 2,500 Jewish children out of the Warsaw Ghetto and then provided them with false identity documents and shelter outside the ghetto, saving those children from the Holocaust. With the exception of diplomats who issued visas to help Jews flee Nazi-occupied Europe, Sendler saved more Jews than any other individual during the Holocaust. The German occupiers eventually discovered her activities and she was arrested by the Gestapo, tortured, and sentenced to death, but she managed to evade execution and survive the war. In 1965, Sendler was recognised by the State of Israel as Righteous Among the Nations. Late in life she was awarded the Order of the White Eagle, Poland's highest honor, for her wartime humanitarian efforts.",

After starting his career as a novelist and journalist, Arniches turned to theatre in 1888 with the publication of his first play, \"Casa Editorial\". Much of his work is set in lower-class Madrid and uses colloquial language, song, dance and music. Arniches was complimented in a 1935 interview by Federico García Lorca, often a scathing critic of Spanish theatre in the 1920s and 1930s, as \"more of a poet than almost any of those who are writing theatre in verse at the moment\". Following the consolidation of the Franco regime after the Spanish Civil War, the social dramas of Carlos Arniches were among the relatively non-controversial plays allowed by the new government.",

    "evidence": "Sir Josiah Mason (23 February 1795 - 16 June 1881) was an English industrialist, engaged in pen manufacture and other trades, and a philanthropist. He founded Mason Science College in 1875, which later became the University of Birmingham. He was the son of a carpet-weaver and was born in Mill Street, Kidderminster. He began life as a street hawker of cakes, fruits, and vegetables. After trying his hand in his native town at shoemaking, baking, carpentry, blacksmithing, house-painting, and carpet-weaving, he moved in 1816 to Birmingham. There he found employment in the gilt-toy trade. In 1824, he set up on his own account as a manufacturer of split-rings by machinery, to which he subsequently added the making of steel pens. Owing to the circumstance of his pens being supplied through James Perry, the London stationer whose name they bore, he was less well known than Joseph Gillott and other makers, although he was really the largest producer in England, contributing heavily to the Birmingham pen trade. In 1874, the business was converted into a limited liability company. Besides his steel-pen trade, Mason carried on for many years the business of electro-plating, copper-smelting, and India-rubber ring making, in conjunction with George Elkington. Mason was almost entirely self-educated, having taught himself to write when a shoemaker's apprentice, and in later life he felt his deficiencies keenly. It was this which led him in 1860 to establish his great orphanage at Erdington, near Birmingham. Upon it he expended about £300,000, and for this munificent endowment he was knighted in 1872. He had previously given a dispensary to his native town and an almshouse to Erdington. In 1880, Mason College, since incorporated in the University of Birmingham, was opened. The total value of the endowment was about £250,000.",

Cushnahan was educated at St Mary's Christian Brothers Grammar School and Queen's University, Belfast, and worked as a teacher before going into politics. He worked as General Secretary of the Alliance Party from 1974 until 1982 and was a member of Belfast City Council between 1977 and 1985. In 1982, he was elected to the prior Assembly for North Down and two years later he became the new leader of Alliance, succeeding Oliver Napier. During his tenure as leader, he sought to strengthen the party's links with the British Liberal Party. The Anglo Irish Agreement was signed during this period and Cushnahan faced the difficult position of giving Alliance support to it and facing the united opposition of the Unionist parties. However, when the Assembly was dissolved in 1986, Cushnahan found it financially difficult to remain in politics and so stood down as leader in 1987 to be succeeded by John Alderdice. Two years later, Cushnahan made a surprise political comeback when he moved to the Republic of Ireland and stood as a Fine Gael candidate in the 1989 election to the European Parliament, winning a seat in the Munster constituency. He was an MEP for fifteen years before retiring at the 2004 elections. Cushnahan now serves as a board member of the peace and reconciliation charity Co-operation Ireland.",

He played for the Buffalo Bisons, Detroit Wolverines, Kansas City Cowboys, Baltimore Orioles, and Cincinnati Red Stockings (AA). At the start of the 1882 season, clubs playing in the American Association had their players wear non-matching silk uniforms, with a different color and/or pattern corresponding to each position in the field. Accordingly, on opening day for the Red Stockings, Stearns wore an unusual candy-striped jersey. On September 11, 1882, Stearns was involved in a notable milestone, when pitcher Tony Mullane of the Louisville Eclipse pitched the first no-hit game in the history of the American Association against Stearns and his teammates on the Cincinnati Red Stockings, a 2-0 win by Louisville. Stearns made the game's final out by bouncing into a fielder's choice that forced runner Pop Snyder at second base. The Red Stockings had the last laugh, however, ending the year as the AA's inaugural champions. Unsatisfied with their first-base play in 1882, the Red Stockings signed Long John Reilly of the New York Metropolitans to replace Stearns prior to the 1883 season. Stearns spent the 1887 season with the Topeka Golden Giants of the Western League, leading that league in hits. That team finished with a dominant record of 90-25, and is sometimes described as the strongest minor league baseball club of the 19th century. Stearns is also notable as one of the first Jews to play Major League Baseball. His status as such made him popular with Jewish youths who were fans of the game.",

He was strong, big, well-educated, sophisticated, charismatic, charming, and hungry for success. He never looked flashy, yet was never boring. Kılıç was the mastermind behind the rise of Turkish football, schooling football players that would become respectable managers after their career. He took a break from his career in 1938, moving to Germany for a university education. When he returned to Turkey, he again wore the Galatasaray shirt and won two league championships with the team. Kılıç, who played 11 matches with the Turkey national football team, played for Galatasaray until 1953, except for when he played for Ankara Demirspor during his national service military obligation. His five goals against Beşiktaş JK are still a record for all three Istanbulian derbies.

He led his team to several championships after eighteen years without a championship between 1934 and 1952. He also transferred Turkish superstar Metin Oktay to the team.

A true gentleman both on and off the field, Gündüz Kılıç helped Galatasaray to reach new targets.

NOFX's mainstream success was signified by a growing interest in punk rock during the 1990s, but unlike many of their contemporaries (including Green Day and The Offspring), they have never been signed to a major label. NOFX has released twelve studio albums, fifteen extended plays, and a number of seven-inch singles. Their latest studio album, \"Self Entitled\", was released on September 11, 2012. The group has sold over 8 million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful independent bands of all time. The band also broadcast their own show on Fuse TV entitled \"NOFX: Backstage Passport\".",

They started life in the late 1990s at Bartholomew School in Eynsham, with Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (then on guitar) writing songs, then recruiting a drummer and bass player through an ad. They played their first gig in early 1999 and fired the bass player a few months later, with Ben Thomas switching from guitar to bass. By the summer of 2000, Perrier and Thomas' dissatisfaction with their drummer led to his departure, with Thomas switching from bass to drums so the band could continue as a two-piece. Winnebago Deal now consists of two Bens, Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (drums).\n\nWinnebago Deal generated strong support from many appearances at Oxford's Zodiac Club, eventually supporting Fugazi at London's Forum; this led to their first record, the \"Plata o Plomo\" EP in 2003. They were nominated for the Kerrang Award's \"Best British Newcomer\" that year. Soon after, the band signed a recording contract with Double Dragon Music, and produced their debut album \"Dead Gone\" with Jack Endino, producer of the first Nirvana album \"Bleach\". \"Dead Gone\" was released in September 2004. \"Plata o Plomo\" was reissued in Australia later that year, with an expanded track listing.\n\nThe \"two Bens\" then went on to play as Mondo Generator with Nick Oliveri, former Queens of the Stone Age bassist-vocalist. As well as playing Mondo Generator gigs, they still toured as Winnebago Deal and even supported Mondo Generator, earning them the moniker \"Winnebago Generator\" from fans. After recording tracks at Dave Grohl's Studio 606 for the next Mondo Generator album with producer Nick Raskulinecz, it was announced in July 2006 that they had left the band for \"undisclosed reasons\". In that same month they released their second full-length album \"Flight of the Raven\", with the band again choosing to record with producer Jack Endino. The album features guest appearances from other artists including band partner Nick Oliveri, Endino, Paul Morrill and Edward \"Raven\" Heaton from the band Sicarios, and Rusty Needles of Oxford band Deguello, and was cited as the sixth best album in 2006 by \"Kerrang!\" writer Raziq Rauf.\n\nWinnebago Deal's third full-length album, \"Career Suicide\", was recorded in November 2009 and released a year later.",

    "evidence": "Pattern is Movement (often stylized as Pattern is Movement) is an American indie rock band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that was established in 2001. They have been categorized by some reviewers as a math rock group and compared to groups such as Don Caballero, Sunny Day Real Estate, and Pinback. However, as the band moved from a five-piece to a two-piece, their sound moved away from the angular sound of previous records and closer to a more melodic heavy composition structure with sing-a-long choruses. The current two-piece sound can be attributed to influences such as Dirty Projectors, Beirut, and Grizzly Bear. In an interview with Baeble Music, Ward coined the band with the term \"indie cabaret\". In 2006, producer and engineer Scott Solter (who has worked with John Vanderslice and The Mountain Goats) remixed the 2005 album Stowaway, which he had also recorded. This remix was considered unique due to its exclusivity to analog processes. Solter is credited on the album with \"machines, razors, tape\". Since 2008, Pattern is Movement have been performing as a two-piece. On the January 2008 issue of Philadelphia Weekly, they were featured in a cover story citing \"four indie bands that can expect a big year\". The band emerged with a new album, All Together, documenting the lineup in the spring of 2008, also recorded with Solter. In his favorable review, Pitchfork Media writer Joe Tangari described it as \"an accessible album that nonetheless sounds unlike what any other band is doing\". In April 2009, they became one of Limewire's featured artists. In 2015, after releasing their self-titled fourth album, Pattern is Movement announced their farewell tour.",

Indeed, if one sets aside his own monumental artistic creations, his other activities on behalf of art, history, and culture would still have guaranteed him a place at the very heart of the artistic and cultural history of Norway.

    "evidence": "C.V. Ananda Bose is an Indian civil servant who served in the Indian Administrative Service. He is notable for not yielding to the corrupt system of the Indian bureaucracy. An eminent administrator, writer, orator, and innovator, Dr. C.V. Ananda Bose pioneered pathbreaking administrative innovations in rural development, affordable housing, eco-tourism development, redressal of public grievances, women's empowerment, development of weaker sections of society, and promotion of art and culture. The innovations have found expression in various developmental programmes that have been executed at the district, state, and national levels in India.\n\nIt was in the area of low-cost housing that Dr. Bose pioneered a movement that won international acclaim. He set up the first Nirmithi Kendra (building centre) in the country in the Kollam district, which became the institutional mechanism for the propagation of cost-effective, environment-friendly (CEEF) building technology. This was positively evaluated by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Government of India (1993). Based on the Kollam model, the Government of India launched the National Building Centre Movement to replicate Nirmithi Kendras (building centres) in every district of the country. The Nirmithi Movement was adjudged by the United Nations as one of the global best practices in the field of sustainable human settlement development.\n\nEarly in his career, Dr. Bose introduced the \"Gramotsava\" programme in Kerala, wherein the local people were encouraged to actively participate in the village development planning. The initiative, launched in the Kasargode district of Kerala in the 1980s, was subsequently implemented in 200 panchayats across the state. Dr. Bose also founded the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in the Kollam district during his tenure as Collector. The Council generated high tourism interest in the region and created new job opportunities for the local people. The Government of Kerala subsequently set up similar councils in all 14 districts of the state. DTPs have made perceptible contributions in positioning Kerala as \"God's own country\".\n\nHe later pioneered an eco-village programme in the Mannanan village of the Kottayam district of Kerala, wherein the family clusters were encouraged to pursue activities such as organic farming, soil and water conservation through traditional methods, floriculture, horticulture, vermiculture, generation of energy from non-conventional sources, homestead forestry, etc., with institutional support, governmental assistance, and financial support from different agencies.\n\nAs Chairman of the Atomic Energy Education Society, Mumbai, Dr. Bose introduced and reinforced the concept of alternative education, wherein people could pursue studies in disciplines in which they did not have prior academic backgrounds. He founded the Institute of Alternative Education. He also launched the ASTER Project (Application of Science & Technology in Educational Reforms) which sought to alter the mode of academic delivery through the application of information and communication technology (ICT).\n\nAs Managing Director of NAFED, Dr. Bose initiated a few innovative programmes which helped control the price spiral during 2009-10. Christened as \"Farm Gate to Home Gate\", this innovation sought to buy agricultural produce directly from the farmers for distribution among the consumers, taking only marginal profit. Spurred by the success of this pilot programme in New Delhi, the Easy Market Scheme was envisaged for price control in the rest of the country.\n\nAs the administrator of the National Museum, Dr. Bose launched a 100-day programme which spelt out specific measures to revamp and revitalise the institution. Most of the improvements suggested were achieved in 60 days, such as opening the closed-down galleries, modernising the display and lighting, launching outreach programmes to take the museum to the community, arranging children's programmes to ignite young minds to the greatness of India's national heritage, organising international exhibitions, and launching the People's Museum Movement, to mention a few.\n\nPursuit of excellence was always central to Dr. Bose's role in public administration. His contributions were seldom circumscribed by the call of duty. Instead, he has been engaged in continuous research and field experimentation in developing the most appropriate, people-first solutions. He also took key steps to synergise the various government programmes and schemes to create comprehensive, sustainable, and inclusive administrative mechanisms that have since been replicated in multiple domains.\n\nIn recognition of this remarkable turnaround of the museum management and the perceptible makeover of the institution, the Government of India asked Dr. Bose to continue with this mission even after his retirement from service.",

    "evidence": "Mayhew Y. \"Bo\" Foster (October 9, 1911 – March 21, 2011) was an American soldier who flew captured Nazi war criminal Hermann Göring from Austria to Germany for interrogation by the 7th Army. For his actions in World War II, Foster was awarded both the Silver Star and the Légion d'Honneur. At the end of the war, Göring surrendered to the Allied Powers in the Bavarian Alps. On May 9, 1945, Foster transported Göring back to Germany on a 55-minute flight in an unescorted, unarmed L-5, a larger plane than the L4 he normally piloted, because Göring weighed more than. According to \"China Daily\", in a letter to his wife, Virginia, written at the time, Foster describes his first impression of Göring as \"effeminate gave me the creeps...several times I had the impulse to turn the plane over and see if I could shake him out, but he was wedged in like a champagne cork.\" Foster said that Göring, who spoke some English, avoided any talk of Adolf Hitler, with whom Göring – as the commander of the Luftwaffe – had fallen out of favor as the total German defeat neared. \"He acted as though he was going on a sightseeing tour, or really as though I was going on a sightseeing tour, and he was showing me where he grew up. I had a .45 in a shoulder holster, but he couldn't reach that. But neither could I, because I had two hands controlling the plane.\" Foster further recalled Göring as having been sharp, friendly, and witty, having joked when Foster asked him when Germany began manufacturing jets. \"Too late,\" Göring was said to have answered. Foster continued: \"I could see that he was like one of our officers if he'd been picked up. I questioned all that we knew about these vicious people.\" Göring was convicted of war crimes and committed suicide in October 1946 by taking a cyanide capsule before he could be hanged by the Nuremberg authorities.\n\nBy October 1945, Foster was back in the United States, having flown seventy reconnaissance combat missions during his wartime service. He returned to his adopted home state of Montana, where he was appointed Lieutenant Colonel in the Montana Army National Guard. He was thereafter promoted to Brigadier General, a rank that he held from 1963 until 1971. A native of Richmond, Virginia, Foster graduated in 1937 with a degree in English from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. He and his wife, Virginia Lou Foster (February 15, 1916 – May 7, 1993) were married in 1940. The couple had one daughter, Susan Carol Foster Korkalo (1944 – 2007). Foster received the Silver Star for his wartime service in Southern France in 1944. It was not until 2009 that he received the French Legion of Honor, when Pierre Vimont, the French Ambassador to the United States, released a letter hailing Foster for his \"personal, precious contribution to the United States' decisive role in the liberation of our country during World War II.\" Foster died at the age of ninety-nine in a nursing home in Missoula, Montana. His last city of residence was Livingston in Park County, Montana. Survivors included son-in-law Roy E. Korkalo of Livingston, grandson Chris Korkalo, and a sister, Priscilla F. Howell.",

Against his positivist contemporaries, Windelband argued that philosophy should engage in humanistic dialogue with the natural sciences rather than uncritically appropriating its methodologies. His interests in psychology and cultural sciences represented an opposition to psychologism and historicism schools by a critical philosophic system. Windelband relied in his effort to reach beyond Kant on such philosophers as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Johann Friedrich Herbart, and Hermann Lotze. Closely associated with Windelband was Heinrich Rickert. Windelband's disciples were not only noted philosophers, but sociologists like Max Weber and theologians like Ernst Troeltsch and Albert Schweitzer.",

Kurowski batted and threw right-handed. He debuted on September 23, 1941, and played his final game on October 1, 1949. In a nine-season career, Kurowski posted a .286 batting average with 106 home runs and 529 RBI in 916 games played. Kurowski's childhood nickname came from his already white hair. A native of Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski overcame several personal problems. He overcame childhood osteomyelitis, which made him miss a part of a bone on his right forearm. Before he started his baseball career, his older brother died in a mine accident, and his father died from a heart attack during spring training in 1942. His most productive season came in 1945, when he posted career-highs in average (.310), home runs (27), RBI (104), runs (108), doubles (27), slugging percentage (.544) and on-base percentage (.420). An All-Star during five consecutive seasons (1943–47), Kurowski exceeded the 20 home run mark three times to set a major league record for a third baseman (1944–45, 1947), and hit over .300 three times (1945–47). He also led the National League three times in putouts, twice in fielding percentage, and once in double plays. In four World Series appearances, Kurowski hit .253 (21-for-83) with one home run and nine RBI in 23 games, as the Cardinals were world champions in 1942, 1944 and 1946. His only home run in the series, in 1942, off Red Ruffing, broke a 2–2 tie in the ninth inning of Game Five to clinch the title for St. Louis over the New York Yankees.

After that, he coached and managed in the minor leagues for 18 years until 1972. He gained induction into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame in 1988. In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \"All-Time All-Star Argument Starter,\" consisting of five ethnic baseball teams.

Against his positivist contemporaries, Windelband argued that philosophy should engage in humanistic dialogue with the natural sciences rather than uncritically appropriating its methodologies. His interests in psychology and cultural sciences represented an opposition to psychologism and historicism schools by a critical philosophic system. Windelband relied in his effort to reach beyond Kant on such philosophers as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Johann Friedrich Herbart, and Hermann Lotze. Closely associated with Windelband was Heinrich Rickert. Windelband's disciples were not only noted philosophers, but sociologists like Max Weber and theologians like Ernst Troeltsch and Albert Schweitzer.",

    "evidence": "Mayhew Y. \"Bo\" Foster (October 9, 1911 – March 21, 2011) was an American soldier who flew captured Nazi war criminal Hermann Göring from Austria to Germany for interrogation by the 7th Army. For his actions in World War II, Foster was awarded both the Silver Star and the Légion d'Honneur. At the end of the war, Göring surrendered to the Allied Powers in the Bavarian Alps. On May 9, 1945, Foster transported Göring back to Germany on a 55-minute flight in an unescorted, unarmed L-5, a larger plane than the L4 he normally piloted, because Göring weighed more than. According to \"China Daily\", in a letter to his wife, Virginia, written at the time, Foster describes his first impression of Göring as \"effeminate gave me the creeps...several times I had the impulse to turn the plane over and see if I could shake him out, but he was wedged in like a champagne cork.\" Foster said that Göring, who spoke some English, avoided any talk of Adolf Hitler, with whom Göring – as the commander of the Luftwaffe – had fallen out of favor as the total German defeat neared. \"He acted as though he was going on a sightseeing tour, or really as though I was going on a sightseeing tour, and he was showing me where he grew up. I had a .45 in a shoulder holster, but he couldn't reach that. But neither could I, because I had two hands controlling the plane.\" Foster further recalled Göring as having been sharp, friendly, and witty, having joked when Foster asked him when Germany began manufacturing jets. \"Too late,\" Göring was said to have answered. Foster continued: \"I could see that he was like one of our officers if he'd been picked up. I questioned all that we knew about these vicious people.\" Göring was convicted of war crimes and committed suicide in October 1946 by taking a cyanide capsule before he could be hanged by the Nuremberg authorities.\n\nBy October 1945, Foster was back in the United States, having flown seventy reconnaissance combat missions during his wartime service. He returned to his adopted home state of Montana, where he was appointed Lieutenant Colonel in the Montana Army National Guard. He was thereafter promoted to Brigadier General, a rank that he held from 1963 until 1971. A native of Richmond, Virginia, Foster graduated in 1937 with a degree in English from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. He and his wife, Virginia Lou Foster (February 15, 1916 – May 7, 1993) were married in 1940. The couple had one daughter, Susan Carol Foster Korkalo (1944 – 2007). Foster received the Silver Star for his wartime service in Southern France in 1944. It was not until 2009 that he received the French Legion of Honor, when Pierre Vimont, the French Ambassador to the United States, released a letter hailing Foster for his \"personal, precious contribution to the United States' decisive role in the liberation of our country during World War II.\" Foster died at the age of ninety-nine in a nursing home in Missoula, Montana. His last city of residence was Livingston in Park County, Montana. Survivors included son-in-law Roy E. Korkalo of Livingston, grandson Chris Korkalo, and a sister, Priscilla F. Howell.",

This epic effort brought to light the main contents of the book, a wealth of botanical information on Malabar that had largely remained inaccessible to English-speaking scholars, because the entire text was in the Latin language. Despite the existence of Hendrik van Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus over the last three centuries, the correct taxonomic identity of many plants listed in Hortus Malabaricus, their medicinal properties, methods of use, etc., as described and codified by renowned traditional medical authorities of 17th century India remained inaccessible to English language-based scholars, until Manilal commenced publication of research papers and books on Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal's efforts ultimately resulted in an English edition of Hortus Malabaricus, for the first time, 325 years after its original publication from Amsterdam. The English edition contains a word-by-word translation of all the twelve volumes of the book, retaining the original style of language. Medicinal properties of plants are translated and interpreted, with commentaries on their Malayalam names given by van Rheede. In addition, the correct scientific identity of all plants, acceptable under ICBN, are set out along with their important synonyms and basionyms. Whilst the scope of Manilal's contributions to botany extend far beyond the research and publications around Hortus Malabaricus, his research work on Hortus Malabaricus alone are of botanical and socio-historic significance, and can be broadly classified under two heads: botanical and medicinal aspects of Hortus Malabaricus; and historical, political, social, and linguistic aspects of Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal has over 198 published research papers and 15 books to his credit as author and co-author. He and his associates have credits to discovering over 14 species of flowering plants, varieties, and combinations new to science. Manilal is the founder president of the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT).",

He became a character actor and supporting player in at least eighty-eight films between 1931 and 1944. Earlier, he appeared in more than twenty Broadway plays. He left school to appear on stage with a repertory company and had no screen experience when he signed a contract with Fox in May 1931. Dinehart's likeness was drawn in caricature by Alex Gard for Sardi's, the New York City theater district restaurant. The picture is now part of the collection of the New York Public Library. Dinehart's first wife was the stage actress Louise Dyer (1895-1934), a native of Nassau County, New York. They were divorced in 1932. In 1933, Dinehart married the film actress Mozelle Britton (May 12, 1912 - May 18, 1953), a native of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. They are entombed together at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. Dinehart had two sons: from the first marriage, Alan Dinehart Jr. (1918-1992), and from the second marriage, Mason Alan Dinehart, aka Alan Dinehart III, born in Los Angeles in 1936. Mason Alan Dinehart was cast in several 1950s television series, including the role of a young Bat Masterson in the ABC/Desilu Studios western, \"The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\", starring Hugh O'Brian in the title role.",

He would entertain her with songs, dances, and pantomimes. In October 1945, Yvonne de Gaulle bought the Château de Vert-Cœur at Milon-la-Chapelle (Yvelines), where they installed a private hospital for handicapped young girls: the \"Fondation Anne de Gaulle\". Anne died of pneumonia on 6 February 1948, aged 20, at Colombey-les-Deux-Églises. Upon her death, her father said: \"Now, she's like the others.\" (\"Maintenant, elle est comme les autres.\") On 22 August 1962, Charles de Gaulle was the victim of an attempted assassination at Petit-Clamart.

    "evidence": "Fei-Ping Hsu (b. 1952 - d. 2001) was a renowned Chinese American pianist known for his sensitive, brilliant, and poetic interpretations. Mr. Hsu was born on the island of Gulangyu in southeast China. As the youngest son of a Christian pastor, he grew up singing hymns while his mother played on an upright piano. One day, when his mother was ill, the five-year-old Fei-Ping went to the piano and played the hymns by ear. The family realized his tremendous talent and encouraged him to study music. When he was eight years old, he had a rare opportunity to meet Professor Ji-Sen Fan, the head of the piano department of the Shanghai Conservatory, and was recognized as a child prodigy. By the time he was twelve, he already played the complete Chopin Etudes and had performed with the Shanghai Philharmonic.\n\nFeiping was invited to perform for Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, who was so impressed with his ability that she personally invited Fei-Ping to study and perform in Europe under her sponsorship. Unfortunately, he was not allowed to accept this invitation due to the advent of the Cultural Revolution during the 1960s. However, he survived the labor camps and became well known in China, touring extensively throughout the Far East as a soloist with the Central Philharmonic, the foremost leading orchestra. He was a gold medal winner at the Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Competition, the first pianist in the competition's history from the People's Republic of China. He also garnered top prizes in other international competitions, including the Gina Bachauer Memorial Piano Scholarship Competition, the University of Maryland International Competition, and the Paloma O'Shea International Competition (Spain).\n\nMr. Hsu made his New York recital debut at Alice Tully Hall in 1983 and performed throughout the United States, including notable appearances at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. He also frequently toured Europe, South America, and the Far East. Mr. Hsu was especially noted for his larger-than-life virtuosic style of Horowitzian pianism.\n\nIn 1979, Fei-Ping Hsu received permission to study in the United States. Among others, he attended the Juilliard School of Music under the tutelage of Sascha Gorodnitzki. He had given numerous concerts in Germany, France, Andorra, Switzerland, and Italy. He has appeared as a soloist with major orchestras, including the Montreal Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Maestro Charles Dutoit, the Moscow Philharmonic in Russia, the Finnish Tempere Symphony Orchestra in Europe, as well as numerous orchestras in the United States performing in various concert halls and music festivals. Mr. Hsu was also actively engaged in his native Asia, where his collaborations include appearances with the China National Symphony Orchestra in Beijing, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the Shanghai Radio Symphony Orchestra, and the Kyushu Symphony Orchestra in Japan.\n\nSince the early 1970s, Mr. Hsu had recorded for major labels such as Columbia Records, RCA Victor Records, Hugo Records, ROI Productions, and MA Recordings in Japan. Highly regarded as one of the foremost pianists of the Western and Romantic traditions, Hsu was also an early champion of the music of the modern composer Huang An-Lun. His life was cut short in a road accident while on a concert tour in China on November 27, 2001, and he is remembered by many to this day. He is survived by his wife and daughter.",

He took the position on June 1, 1994, succeeding Deane Beman, who retired after nearly 20 years in the post. Finchem had previously served as Vice President of Business Affairs, Deputy Commissioner, and Chief Operating Officer of the Tour. Finchem graduated from Princess Anne High School in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He attended the University of Richmond on a debate scholarship, receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1969. He graduated from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1973. After practicing law in Virginia Beach for three years, Finchem served in the White House during the administration of Jimmy Carter as Deputy Advisor to the President in the Office of Economic Affairs in 1978 and 1979. In the early 1980s, Finchem co-founded the National Marketing and Strategies Group in Washington, D.C. As Commissioner, Finchem has greatly expanded the earnings opportunities for PGA Tour players both domestically and internationally. He has presided over the last three television broadcasting deals (1997, 2001 and 2005) and has maximized the earnings potential of the Tour, and perhaps none was as bold as the most recent deal that excludes ABC and ESPN and challenges the Golf Channel to get better. In 2006, the total PGA Tour purse was $256.8 million, up from $56.4 million in 1994. That remarkable growth has a lot to do with Tiger Woods, but Finchem's supporters also give him some of the credit. Finchem received the 2001 Old Tom Morris Award from the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America, GCSAA's highest honor. He is a single-figure handicap golfer.",

    "evidence": "Daniel Eckford Stearns (born October 17, 1861 in Buffalo, New York - June 28, 1944 in Glendale, California), commonly known as \"Ecky\" Stearns, was a Major League Baseball first baseman. He played for the Buffalo Bisons, Detroit Wolverines, Kansas City Cowboys, Baltimore Orioles, and Cincinnati Red Stockings (AA). At the start of the 1882 season, clubs playing in the American Association had their players wear non-matching silk uniforms, with a different color and/or pattern corresponding to each position in the field. Accordingly, on opening day for the Red Stockings, Stearns wore an unusual candy-striped jersey. On September 11, 1882, Stearns was involved in a notable milestone, when pitcher Tony Mullane of the Louisville Eclipse pitched the first no-hit game in the history of the American Association against Stearns and his teammates on the Cincinnati Red Stockings, a 2-0 win by Louisville. Stearns made the game's final out by bouncing into a fielder's choice that forced runner Pop Snyder at second base. The Red Stockings had the last laugh, however, ending the year as the AA's inaugural champions. Unsatisfied with their first-base play in 1882, the Red Stockings signed Long John Reilly of the New York Metropolitans to replace Stearns prior to the 1883 season. Stearns spent the 1887 season with the Topeka Golden Giants of the Western League, leading that league in hits. That team finished with a dominant record of 90-25, and is sometimes described as the strongest minor league baseball club of the 19th century. Stearns is also notable as one of the first Jews to play Major League Baseball. His status as such made him popular with Jewish youths who were fans of the game.",

He retired from the 500 cc race with a blown engine, again riding his 350, when holding third place. He won the 1935 Junior Manx Grand Prix and then joined the Norton team for the 1936 TT races. It was a winning combination as he claimed the Junior TT and finished second in the Senior TT as well as winning the 350 cc European Championship. In 1937 he went one better in the Senior and took a brilliant win and setting the first 90 mph plus lap of the Snaefell Mountain Course.

Freddie also has the distinction of being the first ever 350 cc World Champion in 1949 when he won all five events of the inaugural campaign.

    "evidence": "Hephaestion (c. 356 BC – 324 BC), son of Amyntor, was a Macedonian nobleman and a general in the army of Alexander the Great. He was \"...by far the dearest of all the king's friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets.\" This friendship lasted throughout their lives, and was compared, by others as well as themselves, to that of Achilles and Patroclus. His military career was distinguished. A member of Alexander the Great's personal bodyguard, he went on to command the Companion Cavalry and was entrusted with many other tasks throughout Alexander's ten-year campaign in Asia, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges, and the foundation of new settlements. Besides being a soldier, engineer, and diplomat, he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate the Greeks and Persians. Alexander formally made him his second-in-command when he appointed him Chiliarch of the Empire. Alexander also made him part of the royal family when he gave him as his bride Drypetis, sister to his own second wife Stateira, both daughters of Darius III of Persia. When he died suddenly at Ecbatana around age thirty-two, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief. He petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant Hephaestion divine status, and thus Hephaestion was honored as a \"divine hero\". Hephaestion was cremated in Babylon in the presence of the entire army. At the time of his own death a mere eight months later, Alexander was still planning lasting monuments to Hephaestion's memory.",

    "evidence": "Fei-Ping Hsu (b. 1952 - d. 2001) was a renowned Chinese American pianist known for his sensitive, brilliant, and poetic interpretations. Mr. Hsu was born on the island of Gulangyu in southeast China. As the youngest son of a Christian pastor, he grew up singing hymns while his mother played on an upright piano. One day, when his mother was ill, the five-year-old Fei-Ping went to the piano and played the hymns by ear. The family realized his tremendous talent and encouraged him to study music. When he was eight years old, he had a rare opportunity to meet Professor Ji-Sen Fan, the head of the piano department of the Shanghai Conservatory, and was recognized as a child prodigy. By the time he was twelve, he already played the complete Chopin Etudes and had performed with the Shanghai Philharmonic.\n\nFeiping was invited to perform for Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, who was so impressed with his ability that she personally invited Fei-Ping to study and perform in Europe under her sponsorship. Unfortunately, he was not allowed to accept this invitation due to the advent of the Cultural Revolution during the 1960s. However, he survived the labor camps and became well known in China, touring extensively throughout the Far East as a soloist with the Central Philharmonic, the foremost leading orchestra. He was a gold medal winner at the Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Competition, the first pianist in the competition's history from the People's Republic of China. He also garnered top prizes in other international competitions, including the Gina Bachauer Memorial Piano Scholarship Competition, the University of Maryland International Competition, and the Paloma O'Shea International Competition (Spain).\n\nMr. Hsu made his New York recital debut at Alice Tully Hall in 1983 and performed throughout the United States, including notable appearances at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. He also frequently toured Europe, South America, and the Far East. Mr. Hsu was especially noted for his larger-than-life virtuosic style of Horowitzian pianism.\n\nIn 1979, Fei-Ping Hsu received permission to study in the United States. Among others, he attended the Juilliard School of Music under the tutelage of Sascha Gorodnitzki. He had given numerous concerts in Germany, France, Andorra, Switzerland, and Italy. He has appeared as a soloist with major orchestras, including the Montreal Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Maestro Charles Dutoit, the Moscow Philharmonic in Russia, the Finnish Tempere Symphony Orchestra in Europe, as well as numerous orchestras in the United States performing in various concert halls and music festivals. Mr. Hsu was also actively engaged in his native Asia, where his collaborations include appearances with the China National Symphony Orchestra in Beijing, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the Shanghai Radio Symphony Orchestra, and the Kyushu Symphony Orchestra in Japan.\n\nSince the early 1970s, Mr. Hsu had recorded for major labels such as Columbia Records, RCA Victor Records, Hugo Records, ROI Productions, and MA Recordings in Japan. Highly regarded as one of the foremost pianists of the Western and Romantic traditions, Hsu was also an early champion of the music of the modern composer Huang An-Lun. His life was cut short in a road accident while on a concert tour in China on November 27, 2001, and he is remembered by many to this day. He is survived by his wife and daughter.",

    "evidence": "Tommy Nutter (17 April 1943 – 17 August 1992) was a British tailor, famous for reinventing the Savile Row suit in the 1960s. Born in Barmouth, Merioneth to Christopher Nutter and Dorothy (formerly Banister), he was raised in Edgware, Middlesex, where his father owned a local high street café. After the family moved to Kilburn, Nutter and his brother David attended Willesden Technical College. Nutter initially studied plumbing and then architecture, but he abandoned both aged 19 to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy. In the early 1960s, he joined traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward. After seven years, in 1969, he joined up with Edward Sexton to open \"Nutters of Savile Row\" at No. 35a Savile Row. They were financially backed by Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, managing director of the Beatles' Apple Corps Peter Brown, and lawyer James Vallance-White. The business was an immediate success, as Nutter combined traditional tailoring skills with innovative design. He designed for the Hardy Amies range, and then for the man himself. His clients included his investors, plus Sir Roy Strong, Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger and Elton John. Nutter himself was most proud of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles' album \"Abbey Road\" in 1969, he dressed three out of the four: George Harrison elected to be photographed on the road-crossing in denims.\n\nIn the 1970s, his bespoke business became less successful, but he branched out into ready-to-wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing the Savile Row brand in Japan. In 1976, Sexton bought Nutter out of the business. Nutter went to work for Kilgour French and Stanbury, managing his own workroom. Sexton continued to run Nutters of Savile Row until 1983, when Nutter returned to the Row with a ready-to-wear shop: \"Tommy Nutter, Savile Row\". (This new venture, which traded at No. 19 Savile Row until Tommy's death, was backed by J&J Crombie Limited, who continue to own the \"Tommy Nutter\" trademark.) At this time, Sexton set up a business in his own name. In the 1980s, he described his suits as a \"cross between the big-shouldered 'Miami Vice' look and the authentic Savile Row.\" He created the clothing of the Joker worn by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film \"Batman\". Nutter died in 1992 at the Cromwell Hospital in London of complications from AIDS.",

Born and educated in Russia, Rand moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935–1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful in America, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead. In 1957, she published her best-known work, the novel Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982.\n\nRand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism, and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, instead supporting \"laissez-faire\" capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for some Aristotelians and classical liberals. Literary critics received Rand's fiction with mixed reviews, and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings. She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.",

    "evidence": "Royce Campbell is a jazz guitarist primarily associated with mainstream jazz, but he has also released smooth jazz and post-bop jazz recordings. He was born in Seymour, Indiana, in 1952. The son of a career Navy man, Campbell grew up in various cities around the U.S. and abroad, including Asia, Europe, and the West Indies. Exposure to various musical genres while a child contributed to Campbell's musical style and approach in jazz composition and playing. A love for rock and roll marked Campbell's first connection with the guitar, at the age of nine, when he discovered Chuck Berry. Like many guitarists of his generation, Campbell was also influenced by Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. By the time Royce finished high school in the early 1970s, he was certain he wanted to pursue a professional career in music. His uncle, Carroll Decamp, an arranger/pianist who arranged for Stan Kenton and Les Elgart, invited Royce to live with him and study in Indiana, providing most of Royce's musical education in theory and composition. By age 21, Campbell had begun touring with R&B artist Marvin Gaye and developing his talents for stage performance. In 1975, Royce was hired by a local music contractor to do three concerts with award-winning film composer Henry Mancini in Indianapolis. Soon after, Royce became the touring guitarist with Henry Mancini's orchestra, holding that position until Mancini's death in 1994. While appearing on recordings as a sideman, and a couple as leader, during the early years of his career, Campbell started recording and touring more on his own during the 1990s, focusing at first on mainstream or straight-ahead jazz. Although he cites Wes Montgomery as his main influence, the influence of horn players such as Dexter Gordon and Chet Baker are evident in Royce's melodic style. In 1993, he produced Project G-5: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery, which also featured guitarists Tal Farlow, Jimmy Raney, Herb Ellis, and Cal Collins. His 1994 album 6x6 featured guitarists Pat Martino, John Abercrombie, Larry Coryell, Dave Stryker, and Bucky Pizzarelli. With Project G-5: A Tribute to Joe Pass, in 1999, he combined the talents of Charlie Byrd, Gene Bertoncini, Mundell Lowe, and John Pisano. During his career, Royce Campbell has released more than 30 CDs as leader or co-leader, among various sideman projects. Fifteen of these CDs have made it onto the US National Jazz Radio Charts. Campbell's soloing is documented among other jazz guitarists of the era, in Mel Bay's Anthology of Jazz Guitar Solos: Featuring Solos by the World's Finest Jazz Guitarists! In November 2010, Royce Campbell was inducted into the Indianapolis Jazz Foundation Hall of Fame.",

Indeed, if one sets aside his own monumental artistic creations, his other activities on behalf of art, history, and culture would still have guaranteed him a place at the very heart of the artistic and cultural history of Norway.

For his actions in World War II, Foster was awarded both the Silver Star and the Légion d'Honneur. At the end of the war, Göring surrendered to the Allied Powers in the Bavarian Alps. On May 9, 1945, Foster transported Göring back to Germany on a 55-minute flight in an unescorted, unarmed L-5, a larger plane than the L4 he normally piloted, because Göring weighed more than. According to \"China Daily\", in a letter to his wife, Virginia, written at the time, Foster describes his first impression of Göring as \"effeminate gave me the creeps...several times I had the impulse to turn the plane over and see if I could shake him out, but he was wedged in like a champagne cork.\" Foster said that Göring, who spoke some English, avoided any talk of Adolf Hitler, with whom Göring – as the commander of the Luftwaffe – had fallen out of favor as the total German defeat neared. \"He acted as though he was going on a sightseeing tour, or really as though I was going on a sightseeing tour, and he was showing me where he grew up. I had a .45 in a shoulder holster, but he couldn't reach that. But neither could I, because I had two hands controlling the plane.\" Foster further recalled Göring as having been sharp, friendly, and witty, having joked when Foster asked him when Germany began manufacturing jets. \"Too late,\" Göring was said to have answered. Foster continued: \"I could see that he was like one of our officers if he'd been picked up. I questioned all that we knew about these vicious people.\" Göring was convicted of war crimes and committed suicide in October 1946 by taking a cyanide capsule before he could be hanged by the Nuremberg authorities.\n\nBy October 1945, Foster was back in the United States, having flown seventy reconnaissance combat missions during his wartime service. He returned to his adopted home state of Montana, where he was appointed Lieutenant Colonel in the Montana Army National Guard.

It was not until 2009 that he received the French Legion of Honor, when Pierre Vimont, the French Ambassador to the United States, released a letter hailing Foster for his \"personal, precious contribution to the United States' decisive role in the liberation of our country during World War II.\" Foster died at the age of ninety-nine in a nursing home in Missoula, Montana. His last city of residence was Livingston in Park County, Montana. Survivors included son-in-law Roy E. Korkalo of Livingston, grandson Chris Korkalo, and a sister, Priscilla F. Howell.",

In that series, he took 42 test wickets, including nine on debut, the biggest haul in a series since Jim Laker's 46 in 1956 and the fourth-highest total of all time. Alderman's 42 wickets is the record for the most wickets taken in a series without taking 10 wickets in a match. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the Almanack's 1982 edition. He was disabled from playing for over a year by a shoulder injury sustained on 13 November 1982 when he rashly tackled an English-supporting ground invader at the WACA Ground in Perth. Alderman took part in an unofficial Australian tour of South Africa in 1985–86 and 1986–87, when that country was banned from test cricket as a Commonwealth anti-apartheid sanction. As a result, he received a 3-year ban from international cricket which disqualified him from playing in the 1985 Ashes series in England. Following his suspension, Alderman returned to the Australian side and resumed his success against England, taking 41 wickets in the 1989 Ashes series and another 16 in the 1990–91 series, his final Ashes appearance. He rarely enjoyed similar success against other countries. His final test series was against the West Indies in 1990–91, where he ended his career with 170 test wickets. He was a poor batsman, passing fifty just once in his career and averaging barely eight in first-class cricket. He had three seasons in English county cricket, with Kent (1984 and 1986) and then with Gloucestershire (1988). He now works as a courier for Mercury in Western Australia. On 28 July 2000, Alderman was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for being the all-time leading wicket taker for Western Australia. Alderman's sister Denise Emerson is married to former test umpire Ross Emerson and herself played seven tests for the Australian women's cricket team. Alderman is an alumnus of Aquinas College, Perth.",

He was strong, big, well-educated, sophisticated, charismatic, charming, and hungry for success. He never looked flashy, yet was never boring. Kılıç was the mastermind behind the rise of Turkish football, schooling football players that would become respectable managers after their career. He took a break from his career in 1938, moving to Germany for a university education. When he returned to Turkey, he again wore the Galatasaray shirt and won two league championships with the team. Kılıç, who played 11 matches with the Turkey national football team, played for Galatasaray until 1953, except for when he played for Ankara Demirspor during his national service military obligation. His five goals against Beşiktaş JK are still a record for all three Istanbulian derbies.

Once the captain of the Galatasaray team, Gündüz Kılıç coached his former teammates and the bright young talents he added to the squad. He led his team to several championships after eighteen years without a championship between 1934 and 1952. He also transferred Turkish superstar Metin Oktay to the team.

A true gentleman both on and off the field, Gündüz Kılıç helped Galatasaray to reach new targets. Under his leadership, Galatasaray won numerous championships, Turkish Cup titles, and international matches.

In 1817, he received his doctorate from the University of Würzburg, and spent several years (1827–1842) performing scientific research from his estate in Carnikava (on the banks of the Gauja River near Riga). In 1820, he took part in a scientific expedition to Bokhara as a naturalist. In 1826, he became a member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Pander studied the chick embryo and discovered the germ layers (i.e., three distinct regions of the embryo that give rise to the specific organ system). Because of these findings, he is considered by many to be the \"founder of embryology\". His work in embryology was continued by Karl Ernst von Baer (1792–1876), who expanded Pander's concept of germ layers to include all vertebrates. Pander performed important studies in the field of paleontology, being known for his extensive research on fossils found in the Devonian and Silurian geological strata of the Baltic regions. His study of trilobites from this age led to the adjective \"Panderian\", first used by the Canadian palaeontologist Elkanah Billings. Pander is credited as the first scientist to describe primitive creatures known as conodonts. Today, the Pander Society is an international association of palaeontologists and stratigraphers with a common interest in the study of conodonts. He died in Saint Petersburg.",

He graduated from the Western University of Pennsylvania (today's University of Pittsburgh) in 1877. He married Anne Love in 1882 and the couple had two children. Clapp took an engineering position at Park Brothers' Black Diamond Steel Works. There, along with Captain Alfred E. Hunt, he established the Pittsburgh Testing Laboratory's chemistry department. Hunt formed a company in 1888 to exploit the Charles Martin Hall patents for making aluminum by electrolysis. Clapp was treasurer and secretary of the fledgling company. He resigned as treasurer in 1892 and was replaced by Andrew W. Mellon. The company later became known as the Aluminium Company of America. While Hall is generally credited with the invention of the aluminum process, Clapp raised the initial venture capital to make the process commercially viable; the Mellon interests supplied the company's working capital.\n\nAs Clapp's wealth grew, he pursued his avocational interests in conchology and numismatics. He had begun collecting coins as a boy in the 1870s by sifting through the coins of a toll bridge across the Allegheny River. He later became a founder of the Western Pennsylvania Numismatic Society. His grandfather encouraged him to start collecting shells; over the years he assembled more than 100,000 mollusk shells, which he later donated to the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. In the 1930s he donated his coin collections to both the American Numismatic Society and the Carnegie.\n\nBeginning in 1907 until his death, Clapp was president of Pitt's Board of Trustees. He was a driving force in moving the school from its North Side location to the Oakland district. He also was a trustee of the Carnegie Institute of Technology (today's Carnegie Mellon University) and a member of the American Chemical Society. He died at age 90 on March 31, 1949 at his home in Sewickley, Pennsylvania. Clapp Hall, an academic building on the Pitt campus, is named in his honor.",

He gave rein to eclecticism of sources and methods, using as the occasion demands and warrants elements from myth, oral sources, archaeology, linguistics, material artefacts and written sources.

When Crass founded their own record label, Loder worked as an engineer on most of the label's releases, and when Loder saw potential in a number of bands turned away by Crass Records due to ideological differences, he set up Southern Records. Loder engineered and produced for many bands other than Crass, among them The Jesus and Mary Chain, for whom he engineered the recordings of the \"Psychocandy\" album, Big Black's \"Songs About Fucking\", PJ Harvey, Babes in Toyland, Fugazi, Ministry, and Shellac.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Loder established a television production facility at Southern. Its notable output included the music show \"Snub TV\", which after first being syndicated nationwide in the USA, went on to further success on BBC2 and in other countries. Loder was responsible for encouraging and establishing independent alternative internet ezines, donating the use of Southern's servers and bandwidth, taking part in pioneering online media streaming and simulcasting. Loder died of a brain tumour in 2005, aged 59.",

Four no-hitters were recorded by Anna Mae Hutchison (Belles), Betty Luna (Blue Sox), Carolyn Morris (Peaches), and Amy Irene Applegren (Lassies), while Connie Wisniewski (Chicks) and Dorothy Wiltse (Daisies) topped the league in earned run average with 0.81 and 0.83, respectively.

She was born in Trier, Germany, where her father was stationed. Yvonne de Gaulle was struck by an automobile shortly before Anne's birth. She was born with Down syndrome and lived with her family until her death. De Gaulle's relatives all testified that the general, who was normally undemonstrative in his affections for his family, was more open and extroverted with Anne. He would entertain her with songs, dances, and pantomimes. In October 1945, Yvonne de Gaulle bought the Château de Vert-Cœur at Milon-la-Chapelle (Yvelines), where they installed a private hospital for handicapped young girls: the \"Fondation Anne de Gaulle\". Anne died of pneumonia on 6 February 1948, aged 20, at Colombey-les-Deux-Églises. Upon her death, her father said: \"Now, she's like the others.\" (\"Maintenant, elle est comme les autres.\") On 22 August 1962, Charles de Gaulle was the victim of an attempted assassination at Petit-Clamart. He later said that the potentially fatal bullet had been stopped by the frame of the photograph of Anne that he always carried with him, placed this particular day on the rear shelf of his car. When he died in 1970, he was buried in the cemetery of Colombey beside his beloved daughter.",

    "evidence": "Adamu ɓii Ardo Hassana (c. 1771 – c. 1848), more commonly known as Modibo Adamu, was a Fulani scholar and holy warrior who hailed from the Ba'en clan of Fulbe. He led a jihad into the region of Fumbina (in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria), opening the region for Fulani colonisation. As a result of Adamu's constant warring, the Fulani today make up the largest ethnic group in northern Cameroon (at more than 60% of the region's entire population, which, considering the fact that they weren't from the area, is a remarkable feat), and Islam is the dominant religion. The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region. Adamu studied in Hausaland and earned the title \"Modibo\" (\"Lettered One\") for his scholarship. Upon finishing his studies, he returned home to Gurin and learned of the jihad declared by Fulani mystic Usman dan Fodio. When he accompanied a delegation to visit Usman, the leader ordered Adamu to extend his jihad east as \"Lamido Fumbina\" (Ruler of the Southlands). Adamu raised an army and attacked Bata settlements near Gurin. He took the villages, and many more traditional Fulbe leaders and new soldiers came to his side. He next took on Mandara, the largest and best organised state in the region. He swept over several smaller settlements and eventually conquered the Mandara capital, Dulo, with ease. While his men celebrated, however, the Mandara army counterattacked and recaptured the town. Though he fought many more campaigns, Adamu now spent most of his time in Yola, which became his capital. He set about creating the administrative structure of his new state, which he named Adamawa after himself. Adamu ruled the empire, subordinate only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. Below him lay the heads of major settlements, known as Lamibe (singular: Lamido). The village formed the smallest unit of government. Upon Adamu's death in 1847, his son Muhammadu Lawal became Lamido of Adamawa. The empire was not to last, however, as colonial battles and division eventually destroyed the independent Fulani state. The conquest had long-term repercussions, however. The Fulani became the dominant ethnic group in the region, and Islam the major religion. The herdsmen altered the land to be more suitable for herding cattle, their primary pursuit. The jihad also pushed those peoples who had lived on the Adamawa Plateau south into the forest, the single most important event in the populating of southern Cameroon.",

He became very famous during his own lifetime. After Wolfe's death, his contemporary William Faulkner said that Wolfe may have had the best talent of their generation. Wolfe's influence extends to the writings of famous Beat writer Jack Kerouac, authors Ray Bradbury and Philip Roth, among others.

He retired from the 500 cc race with a blown engine, again riding his 350, when holding third place. He won the 1935 Junior Manx Grand Prix and then joined the Norton team for the 1936 TT races. It was a winning combination as he claimed the Junior TT and finished second in the Senior TT as well as winning the 350 cc European Championship. In 1937 he went one better in the Senior and took a brilliant win and setting the first 90 mph plus lap of the Snaefell Mountain Course. After finishing third in the 1939 Senior he missed the 1947 TT due to a practice spill on a 500 cc Moto Guzzi. Turning to Velocettes in 1948, he won the Junior race, repeating this success a year later. Freddie also has the distinction of being the first ever 350 cc World Champion in 1949 when he won all five events of the inaugural campaign. Frith, alongside other riders from BSA, Ariel and Matchless works teams, served in the army during World War II at the Infantry Driving & Maintenance School stationed at Keswick, where officers and NCOs learned how to ride cross-country.

They have been categorized by some reviewers as a math rock group and compared to groups such as Don Caballero, Sunny Day Real Estate, and Pinback. However, as the band moved from a five-piece to a two-piece, their sound moved away from the angular sound of previous records and closer to a more melodic heavy composition structure with sing-a-long choruses. The current two-piece sound can be attributed to influences such as Dirty Projectors, Beirut, and Grizzly Bear. In an interview with Baeble Music, Ward coined the band with the term \"indie cabaret\". In 2006, producer and engineer Scott Solter (who has worked with John Vanderslice and The Mountain Goats) remixed the 2005 album Stowaway, which he had also recorded. This remix was considered unique due to its exclusivity to analog processes. Solter is credited on the album with \"machines, razors, tape\". Since 2008, Pattern is Movement have been performing as a two-piece. On the January 2008 issue of Philadelphia Weekly, they were featured in a cover story citing \"four indie bands that can expect a big year\".

    "evidence": "Timothy W. Finchem (born April 19, 1947) is the current Commissioner of Golf's PGA Tour. Finchem was born in Ottawa, Illinois. He took the position on June 1, 1994, succeeding Deane Beman, who retired after nearly 20 years in the post. Finchem had previously served as Vice President of Business Affairs, Deputy Commissioner, and Chief Operating Officer of the Tour. Finchem graduated from Princess Anne High School in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He attended the University of Richmond on a debate scholarship, receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1969. He graduated from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1973. After practicing law in Virginia Beach for three years, Finchem served in the White House during the administration of Jimmy Carter as Deputy Advisor to the President in the Office of Economic Affairs in 1978 and 1979. In the early 1980s, Finchem co-founded the National Marketing and Strategies Group in Washington, D.C. As Commissioner, Finchem has greatly expanded the earnings opportunities for PGA Tour players both domestically and internationally. He has presided over the last three television broadcasting deals (1997, 2001 and 2005) and has maximized the earnings potential of the Tour, and perhaps none was as bold as the most recent deal that excludes ABC and ESPN and challenges the Golf Channel to get better. In 2006, the total PGA Tour purse was $256.8 million, up from $56.4 million in 1994. That remarkable growth has a lot to do with Tiger Woods, but Finchem's supporters also give him some of the credit. Finchem received the 2001 Old Tom Morris Award from the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America, GCSAA's highest honor. He is a single-figure handicap golfer.",

His prolific work, drawing on the traditions of the género chico, the zarzuela and the grotesque, came to dominate Spanish comic theatre in the early twentieth century. After starting his career as a novelist and journalist, Arniches turned to theatre in 1888 with the publication of his first play, \"Casa Editorial\". Much of his work is set in lower-class Madrid and uses colloquial language, song, dance and music. Arniches was complimented in a 1935 interview by Federico García Lorca, often a scathing critic of Spanish theatre in the 1920s and 1930s, as \"more of a poet than almost any of those who are writing theatre in verse at the moment\". Following the consolidation of the Franco regime after the Spanish Civil War, the social dramas of Carlos Arniches were among the relatively non-controversial plays allowed by the new government.",

Frith had the distinction of being one of the few to win TT races before and after the Second World War. He entered his first major race, the first Manx Grand Prix in 1930, riding an over-the-counter 350 cc Velocette KTT in the Junior event, finishing third at a speed of 60.34 mph. He retired from the 500 cc race with a blown engine, again riding his 350, when holding third place. He won the 1935 Junior Manx Grand Prix and then joined the Norton team for the 1936 TT races. It was a winning combination as he claimed the Junior TT and finished second in the Senior TT as well as winning the 350 cc European Championship. In 1937 he went one better in the Senior and took a brilliant win and setting the first 90 mph plus lap of the Snaefell Mountain Course. After finishing third in the 1939 Senior he missed the 1947 TT due to a practice spill on a 500 cc Moto Guzzi. Turning to Velocettes in 1948, he won the Junior race, repeating this success a year later. Freddie also has the distinction of being the first ever 350 cc World Champion in 1949 when he won all five events of the inaugural campaign.

    "evidence": "King Zhuang of Chu (died 591 BC) was a monarch of the Zhou dynasty state of Chu during the Spring and Autumn period of ancient Chinese history. His personal name was Xiong Lü, ancestral name Mi (芈), and King Zhuang was his posthumous title. He became one of the Five Hegemons and attempted to wrest control of China from the King of Zhou. King Zhuang ascended the throne in 613 BC at a time when the kingdom of Chu was in disarray. For the first three years of his reign, Zhuang wasted time on excessive hunting and lavish partying. Several courtiers were anxious about the king, but none dared speak up as he had given orders that anyone who challenged his authority would be killed. When a particularly senior minister challenged him through a riddle, the king responded that he had been waiting for three years for someone from his court to show some nationalistic pride. The king made Sunshu Ao chancellor and began a series of reforms. Chu's agricultural output improved significantly during his reign, aided by Sunshu Ao's comprehensive dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir created in modern-day northern Anhui province. In 611 BC he annexed the state of Yong (庸国), a move which made Chu much stronger. After some overwhelming victories at the head of his army, King Zhuang attempted to take the place of King Ding of Zhou. He asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the nine tripod cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China at the time, but was rebuffed. In the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the state of Jin, another strong state at that time. Later he achieved hegemony amongst some other states. His progress from lazy regent to a hegemon of his time gave rise to the Chinese four-character idiom of \"Yī Mǐng Jīng Rén\" (一冥而惊人).",

    "evidence": "Robert Holgate (1481/1482–1555) was Bishop of Llandaff and then Archbishop of York (from 1545 to 1554). He recognised Henry VIII as head of the Church of England. Although a protégé of Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, Holgate had a career in the Gilbertine Order of which he became Master. Most of the Gilbertine houses were lesser establishments which should have been dissolved under the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535 (only four out of twenty-six houses had revenues over £200 a year). However, Holgate is credited with using his influence to save them for a few years. For example, Malton Priory, one of the lesser Gilbertine houses, was the last of them to surrender in December 1539, whereas Sempringham Priory, worth more than £200 a year, surrendered in 1538.\n\nIn 1550 Holgate married Barbara Wentworth, who was about 25 at the time. This may, however, have been a second marriage to make it fully legal, and Holgate and Wentworth may have first married in late 1547 with Roger Tongue officiating. In 1551 Arthur Norman claimed that he was already married to Barbara Wentworth, but the courts decided that their marriage when she was about seven had not been a binding legal transaction. Robert and Barbara remained married until 1553, when shortly after Mary I of England came to the throne she imprisoned Holgate on various charges, with his being a married clergy being central to these. In 1554 Holgate renounced his marriage claiming he had only entered it to avoid suspicion as a papist.\n\nIn January 1555 Holgate was released from prison, but he was not restored to priestly office. He died later that year. In 1558 a Robert Holgate from Yorkshire entered the University of Cambridge. He may have been a son of Holgate, since there are some claims he had two children by Barbara, but there is no conclusive evidence on the matter.",

He climbed widely around the Northeast United States, and especially at New York's Shawangunk Ridge. Although the Appalachian Mountain Club was dominant in the area at the time, and strictly regulated rock climbing, Lester was never associated with the club, and found himself in conflict with the leading climber in the area, Hans Kraus, who was head of the AMC's safety committee.

Izzo has led the Spartans to the 2000 NCAA Division I National Championship, the 2009 NCAA Division I National Championship game, seven Final Fours, and seven Big Ten Championships in his first 18 years at Michigan State. The coach with the most wins in school history, Izzo's teams have earned invitations to the past 18 consecutive NCAA tournaments, in addition to setting the Big Ten record for the longest home winning streak. These accomplishments led analyst Andy Katz at ESPN to deem Michigan State the top college basketball program for the decade from 1998 to 2007. Currently the longest tenured coach in the Big Ten Conference, Izzo, whose teams are often recognized for their rebounding prowess and defensive tenacity, has won four national coach of the year awards and maintains a considerable coaching tree—several of his former assistants are currently head coaches at other Division I schools. Izzo is just the fifth coach in Big Ten history to win seven conference titles. His immense success during the NCAA tournament has earned Izzo the nickname \"Mr. March\" among active coaches.",

    "evidence": "George John Kurowski (April 19, 1918 – December 9, 1999) was a third baseman in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the St. Louis Cardinals (1949). Kurowski batted and threw right-handed. He debuted on September 23, 1941, and played his final game on October 1, 1949. In a nine-season career, Kurowski posted a .286 batting average with 106 home runs and 529 RBI in 916 games played. Kurowski's childhood nickname came from his already white hair. A native of Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski overcame several personal problems. He overcame childhood osteomyelitis, which made him miss a part of a bone on his right forearm. Before he started his baseball career, his older brother died in a mine accident, and his father died from a heart attack during spring training in 1942. His most productive season came in 1945, when he posted career-highs in average (.310), home runs (27), RBI (104), runs (108), doubles (27), slugging percentage (.544) and on-base percentage (.420). An All-Star during five consecutive seasons (1943–47), Kurowski exceeded the 20 home run mark three times to set a major league record for a third baseman (1944–45, 1947), and hit over .300 three times (1945–47). He also led the National League three times in putouts, twice in fielding percentage, and once in double plays. In four World Series appearances, Kurowski hit .253 (21-for-83) with one home run and nine RBI in 23 games, as the Cardinals were world champions in 1942, 1944 and 1946. His only home run in the series, in 1942, off Red Ruffing, broke a 2–2 tie in the ninth inning of Game Five to clinch the title for St. Louis over the New York Yankees. He also appeared five times in the MVP ballot, in 1942 and from 1944 through 1947. In 1949, Kurowski developed arm and elbow problems and his playing career ended. After that, he coached and managed in the minor leagues for 18 years until 1972. He gained induction into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame in 1988. In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \"All-Time All-Star Argument Starter,\" consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Kurowski was the third baseman on Stein's Polish team. Kurowski died in Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania, at age 81.",

Born in Yonkers, New York, Ridzik was signed by the Phillies at the age of 16 and made his Major League debut on September 4, 1950, pitching in relief. In 1951, Ridzik started 12 games and relieved in 30 more, going 9-6 with an earned run average of 3.77.

Ridzik signed with the Washington Senators three years later in 1961 after developing a knuckleball. He would appear in 132 games, mostly in relief, over the next three years for the Senators. On April 13, 1964, his contract was sold back to his original team, the Phillies. He would appear in two games with the Phillies that year before calling it a career. After life as a baseball player, Ridzik worked in the Washington D.C. area for a military food distributor until moving to Florida in the late 1980s.

This epic effort brought to light the main contents of the book, a wealth of botanical information on Malabar that had largely remained inaccessible to English-speaking scholars, because the entire text was in the Latin language. Despite the existence of Hendrik van Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus over the last three centuries, the correct taxonomic identity of many plants listed in Hortus Malabaricus, their medicinal properties, methods of use, etc., as described and codified by renowned traditional medical authorities of 17th century India remained inaccessible to English language-based scholars, until Manilal commenced publication of research papers and books on Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal's efforts ultimately resulted in an English edition of Hortus Malabaricus, for the first time, 325 years after its original publication from Amsterdam. The English edition contains a word-by-word translation of all the twelve volumes of the book, retaining the original style of language. Medicinal properties of plants are translated and interpreted, with commentaries on their Malayalam names given by van Rheede. In addition, the correct scientific identity of all plants, acceptable under ICBN, are set out along with their important synonyms and basionyms. Whilst the scope of Manilal's contributions to botany extend far beyond the research and publications around Hortus Malabaricus, his research work on Hortus Malabaricus alone are of botanical and socio-historic significance, and can be broadly classified under two heads: botanical and medicinal aspects of Hortus Malabaricus; and historical, political, social, and linguistic aspects of Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal has over 198 published research papers and 15 books to his credit as author and co-author. He and his associates have credits to discovering over 14 species of flowering plants, varieties, and combinations new to science. Manilal is the founder president of the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT).",

In 1944 he wrote the novel Gli Anni Perduti (The Lost Years), a bold satire of Benito Mussolini's megalomania, and in 1946 Vecchio con gli Stivali (Old Man in Boots), a satirical short story inspired by the vicissitudes of Italian fascism, which won the Vendemmia Award and was adapted into a successful film, Difficult Years, by Luigi Zampa.

Cushnahan was educated at St Mary's Christian Brothers Grammar School and Queen's University, Belfast, and worked as a teacher before going into politics. He worked as General Secretary of the Alliance Party from 1974 until 1982 and was a member of Belfast City Council between 1977 and 1985. In 1982, he was elected to the prior Assembly for North Down and two years later he became the new leader of Alliance, succeeding Oliver Napier. During his tenure as leader, he sought to strengthen the party's links with the British Liberal Party. The Anglo Irish Agreement was signed during this period and Cushnahan faced the difficult position of giving Alliance support to it and facing the united opposition of the Unionist parties. However, when the Assembly was dissolved in 1986, Cushnahan found it financially difficult to remain in politics and so stood down as leader in 1987 to be succeeded by John Alderdice. Two years later, Cushnahan made a surprise political comeback when he moved to the Republic of Ireland and stood as a Fine Gael candidate in the 1989 election to the European Parliament, winning a seat in the Munster constituency. He was an MEP for fifteen years before retiring at the 2004 elections. Cushnahan now serves as a board member of the peace and reconciliation charity Co-operation Ireland.",

    "claim": "He has released several albums as a leader, and has performed and recorded with many jazz musicians, including Pat Martino, Joe Henderson, and Bobby Hutcherson.",
    "evidence": "Royce Campbell is a jazz guitarist primarily associated with mainstream jazz, but he has also released smooth jazz and post-bop jazz recordings. He was born in Seymour, Indiana, in 1952. The son of a career Navy man, Campbell grew up in various cities around the U.S. and abroad, including Asia, Europe, and the West Indies. Exposure to various musical genres while a child contributed to Campbell's musical style and approach in jazz composition and playing. A love for rock and roll marked Campbell's first connection with the guitar, at the age of nine, when he discovered Chuck Berry. Like many guitarists of his generation, Campbell was also influenced by Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. By the time Royce finished high school in the early 1970s, he was certain he wanted to pursue a professional career in music. His uncle, Carroll Decamp, an arranger/pianist who arranged for Stan Kenton and Les Elgart, invited Royce to live with him and study in Indiana, providing most of Royce's musical education in theory and composition. By age 21, Campbell had begun touring with R&B artist Marvin Gaye and developing his talents for stage performance. In 1975, Royce was hired by a local music contractor to do three concerts with award-winning film composer Henry Mancini in Indianapolis. Soon after, Royce became the touring guitarist with Henry Mancini's orchestra, holding that position until Mancini's death in 1994. While appearing on recordings as a sideman, and a couple as leader, during the early years of his career, Campbell started recording and touring more on his own during the 1990s, focusing at first on mainstream or straight-ahead jazz. Although he cites Wes Montgomery as his main influence, the influence of horn players such as Dexter Gordon and Chet Baker are evident in Royce's melodic style. In 1993, he produced Project G-5: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery, which also featured guitarists Tal Farlow, Jimmy Raney, Herb Ellis, and Cal Collins. His 1994 album 6x6 featured guitarists Pat Martino, John Abercrombie, Larry Coryell, Dave Stryker, and Bucky Pizzarelli. With Project G-5: A Tribute to Joe Pass, in 1999, he combined the talents of Charlie Byrd, Gene Bertoncini, Mundell Lowe, and John Pisano. During his career, Royce Campbell has released more than 30 CDs as leader or co-leader, among various sideman projects. Fifteen of these CDs have made it onto the US National Jazz Radio Charts. Campbell's soloing is documented among other jazz guitarists of the era, in Mel Bay's Anthology of Jazz Guitar Solos: Featuring Solos by the World's Finest Jazz Guitarists! In November 2010, Royce Campbell was inducted into the Indianapolis Jazz Foundation Hall of Fame.",

    "evidence": "Lieutenant Junior Grade Tetsuzō Iwamoto was one of the top-scoring aces among the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force (IJNAF) fighter pilots. He entered the Imperial Navy in 1934 and completed pilot training in December 1936. His first combat occurred over China in early 1938, and he emerged as the top naval ace of the campaign, credited with 14 aerial victories. Subsequently, he flew Zeros from the aircraft carrier Zuikaku from December 1941 to May 1942, including at the Battle of the Coral Sea. In late 1943, Iwamoto's air group was sent to Rabaul, New Britain, resulting in three months of the hardest air combat ever undertaken by the IJNAF against air raids mounted by U.S. and Allied air units. Subsequent assignments were Truk Atoll in the Carolines and the Philippines, and he was commissioned an Ensign in October 1944. Following the evacuation of the Philippines, Iwamoto served in home defense and trained Kamikaze pilots. Like many Japanese veterans, Iwamoto was reported to have fallen into depression after the war. His diary was found after his death, with claims of 202 Allied aircraft destroyed. As a result of the Japanese use of the British naval practices, the IJNAF scoring system was based on the system the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force (RAF) adopted from World War I until World War II. This system differed from the scoring system used by the U.S. Navy Air Force and U.S. Marine Air Force during World War II. Dr. Izawa and Professor Hata estimated the figure at about 80 or more than 87 in their research work in January 1971. In December 1993, Izawa wrote that Iwamoto was \"virtually\" the top ace of the IJNAF. As of mid-1944, there remained only two IJNAF fighter pilots who were credited with over 100 victories. Depending on various totals cited, Tetsuzō Iwamoto or Hiroyoshi Nishizawa was Japan's best ace. Iwamoto was known as the Chūtai leader (flying company, squadron of 8 to 16 fighters). Iwamoto was one of few survivors of the IJNAF from the early part of the Second World War. He fought over the Indian and the Pacific Ocean from north to south, and trained his young pilots even in the last months of the war.",

    "evidence": "Philip (29 August 1116 – 13 October 1131) was the King of France from 1129, co-ruling with his father, Louis VI. His mother was Louis VI's second wife, Adelaide of Maurienne. The favourite son of his father as a child, Philip was enthroned alongside Louis VI as joint king in 1129. However, the young king gave his father little joy after that, refusing to pay attention to the old king or to follow the high standards that Louis himself followed. He became disobedient, refusing to heed scoldings or warnings; Walter Map said that he \"strayed from the paths of conduct travelled by his father and, by his overweening pride and tyrannical arrogance, made himself a burden to all.\" Philip's brief period as king was ended two years after his coronation. Riding with a group of companions along the Seine, in the Parisian market section named the Greve, his running horse was tripped by a black pig which darted out of a dung heap on the quay. The horse fell forwards, and the young king was catapulted over its head. The fall \"so dreadfully fractured his limbs that he died on the day following\" without regaining consciousness. He was buried at St Denis, and succeeded as heir, and co-king, by his pious brother, Louis the Younger (now known as Louis VII).\n\nIf Philip had been little other than trouble and a problem to his family and kingdom whilst he had lived, his legacy would prove greater trouble still. Whilst he had lived, he had nurtured a dream of visiting Jerusalem and the tomb of Christ; when he died, his brother, Louis VII, vowed to go in Philip's place. This vow would provide a reason for Louis joining the disastrous Second Crusade and an excuse to abandon Antioch in favour of Jerusalem. The Crusade brought many deaths on both sides, and the abandonment of Antioch proved a strategic failure and a partial cause for the collapse of the marriage between Louis and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Because he was co-king rather than a king in his own right, he is not generally given a number in the succession of Kings of France.",

    "evidence": "Sir John Russell Reynolds, 1st Baronet (22 May 1828 – 29 May 1896) was a British neurologist and physician. Reynolds was born in Romsey, Hampshire, as the son of John Reynolds, an independent minister, and the grandson of Dr. Henry Revell Reynolds. He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851, he graduated M.B. in the University of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852, he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a Fellow of the College in 1859. In the same year, he was appointed Assistant Physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 Assistant Physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865, he became Professor of the Principles and Practice of Medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen's Household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 Vice-President of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian Lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian Oration in 1884, and was elected President in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a Baronet. In the winter of 1895–96, he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as President of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children. The \"Reynolds Baronetcy\", of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death. Reynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an \"Essay on Vertigo\"; in 1855 \"Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves\", as well as \"Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain\"; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 \"Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity\"; in 1872 \"The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity\"; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the \"System of Medicine\", in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write – compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a \"Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe\". Reynolds was a tall man, with dark hair, with a dignified delivery and some oratorical power. Reynolds died in London.",

Officially a left-hand batsman and an off-break bowler, he is said to have seven variations, including the leg-break, googly, carrom ball, doosra, and his stock off-spinner that had impressed national team captain Mahela Jayawardene so much in the nets as to make Jayawardene request him to be fast-tracked into the national squad. Dananjaya had at that point played no first-class, List A, T20, or even U-19 cricket. This in turn led to controversy as his selection was questioned by the media on the basis of a net performance. He was selected to play for Wayamba United in the inaugural Sri Lanka Premier League. In only his second match for the franchise, he took 3-18 against Nagenahira Nagas, consistently disturbing the batsmen with his flight, googly, and other variations.

    "evidence": "Terence Michael Alderman (born 12 June 1956 in Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia) is a former Australian cricketer who played primarily as a right-arm fast-medium bowler of limited pace but nagging accuracy and movement. He began his first-class career in 1974 with Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield and came to international prominence when he was chosen for the Australian national team to tour England in 1981. In that series, he took 42 test wickets, including nine on debut, the biggest haul in a series since Jim Laker's 46 in 1956 and the fourth-highest total of all time. Alderman's 42 wickets is the record for the most wickets taken in a series without taking 10 wickets in a match. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the Almanack's 1982 edition. He was disabled from playing for over a year by a shoulder injury sustained on 13 November 1982 when he rashly tackled an English-supporting ground invader at the WACA Ground in Perth. Alderman took part in an unofficial Australian tour of South Africa in 1985–86 and 1986–87, when that country was banned from test cricket as a Commonwealth anti-apartheid sanction. As a result, he received a 3-year ban from international cricket which disqualified him from playing in the 1985 Ashes series in England. Following his suspension, Alderman returned to the Australian side and resumed his success against England, taking 41 wickets in the 1989 Ashes series and another 16 in the 1990–91 series, his final Ashes appearance. He rarely enjoyed similar success against other countries. His final test series was against the West Indies in 1990–91, where he ended his career with 170 test wickets. He was a poor batsman, passing fifty just once in his career and averaging barely eight in first-class cricket. He had three seasons in English county cricket, with Kent (1984 and 1986) and then with Gloucestershire (1988). He now works as a courier for Mercury in Western Australia. On 28 July 2000, Alderman was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for being the all-time leading wicket taker for Western Australia. Alderman's sister Denise Emerson is married to former test umpire Ross Emerson and herself played seven tests for the Australian women's cricket team.

    "evidence": "Terence Michael Alderman (born 12 June 1956 in Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia) is a former Australian cricketer who played primarily as a right-arm fast-medium bowler of limited pace but nagging accuracy and movement. He began his first-class career in 1974 with Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield and came to international prominence when he was chosen for the Australian national team to tour England in 1981. In that series, he took 42 test wickets, including nine on debut, the biggest haul in a series since Jim Laker's 46 in 1956 and the fourth-highest total of all time. Alderman's 42 wickets is the record for the most wickets taken in a series without taking 10 wickets in a match. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the Almanack's 1982 edition. He was disabled from playing for over a year by a shoulder injury sustained on 13 November 1982 when he rashly tackled an English-supporting ground invader at the WACA Ground in Perth. Alderman took part in an unofficial Australian tour of South Africa in 1985–86 and 1986–87, when that country was banned from test cricket as a Commonwealth anti-apartheid sanction. As a result, he received a 3-year ban from international cricket which disqualified him from playing in the 1985 Ashes series in England. Following his suspension, Alderman returned to the Australian side and resumed his success against England, taking 41 wickets in the 1989 Ashes series and another 16 in the 1990–91 series, his final Ashes appearance. He rarely enjoyed similar success against other countries. His final test series was against the West Indies in 1990–91, where he ended his career with 170 test wickets. He was a poor batsman, passing fifty just once in his career and averaging barely eight in first-class cricket. He had three seasons in English county cricket, with Kent (1984 and 1986) and then with Gloucestershire (1988). He now works as a courier for Mercury in Western Australia. On 28 July 2000, Alderman was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for being the all-time leading wicket taker for Western Australia. Alderman's sister Denise Emerson is married to former test umpire Ross Emerson and herself played seven tests for the Australian women's cricket team. Alderman is an alumnus of Aquinas College, Perth.",

    "evidence": "Lieutenant Junior Grade Tetsuzō Iwamoto was one of the top-scoring aces among the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force (IJNAF) fighter pilots. He entered the Imperial Navy in 1934 and completed pilot training in December 1936. His first combat occurred over China in early 1938, and he emerged as the top naval ace of the campaign, credited with 14 aerial victories. Subsequently, he flew Zeros from the aircraft carrier Zuikaku from December 1941 to May 1942, including at the Battle of the Coral Sea. In late 1943, Iwamoto's air group was sent to Rabaul, New Britain, resulting in three months of the hardest air combat ever undertaken by the IJNAF against air raids mounted by U.S. and Allied air units. Subsequent assignments were Truk Atoll in the Carolines and the Philippines, and he was commissioned an Ensign in October 1944. Following the evacuation of the Philippines, Iwamoto served in home defense and trained Kamikaze pilots. Like many Japanese veterans, Iwamoto was reported to have fallen into depression after the war. His diary was found after his death, with claims of 202 Allied aircraft destroyed. As a result of the Japanese use of the British naval practices, the IJNAF scoring system was based on the system the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force (RAF) adopted from World War I until World War II. This system differed from the scoring system used by the U.S. Navy Air Force and U.S. Marine Air Force during World War II. Dr. Izawa and Professor Hata estimated the figure at about 80 or more than 87 in their research work in January 1971. In December 1993, Izawa wrote that Iwamoto was \"virtually\" the top ace of the IJNAF. As of mid-1944, there remained only two IJNAF fighter pilots who were credited with over 100 victories. Depending on various totals cited, Tetsuzō Iwamoto or Hiroyoshi Nishizawa was Japan's best ace. Iwamoto was known as the Chūtai leader (flying company, squadron of 8 to 16 fighters). Iwamoto was one of few survivors of the IJNAF from the early part of the Second World War. He fought over the Indian and the Pacific Ocean from north to south, and trained his young pilots even in the last months of the war.",

    "evidence": "Paul Taylor (born June 4, 1960, San Francisco, California), formerly credited as Paul Horowitz, is an American musician, who is best known as the keyboardist/guitarist with the late 1980s and early 1990s rock band, Winger (1987--1992, 2001--2003, 2013--2014). Although he is perhaps most frequently associated with Winger, Taylor has also played with numerous other prominent musicians, including future Sammy Hagar and Boston guitarist Gary Pihl (in his early days), Eric Martin (solo artist and future Mr. Big frontman), Aldo Nova, Steve Perry of Journey, Alice Cooper, and Tommy Shaw.\n\nTaylor experienced his first mainstream success in the early 1980s as the touring keyboardist in Canadian musician Aldo Nova's backing band, and he appears in the music video for Nova's biggest hit, \"Fantasy.\" Prior to forming Winger, Taylor and Kip Winger were both playing with Alice Cooper's backing band on the tours for Cooper's mid-80s albums, \"Constrictor\" (1986) and \"Raise Your Fist and Yell\" (1987). During this time, the two began composing songs together and, while on break from touring, recorded what would become the first Winger demos. Whereas Kip left Alice's band prior to the European leg of the 1987 tour, Paul remained on board for the European dates. However, in the midst of touring Europe, Paul received a call from Kip, who had been working with future Winger lead guitarist Reb Beach recording more demos in New York, informing him that he had gotten a record deal. After the European tour was finished, Paul flew straight back to New York, and the Winger project (initially known as \"Sahara\") began rehearsing and recording their debut album.\n\nTaylor remained in Winger throughout the band's most successful period, which included the two smash albums, \"Winger\" and \"In the Heart of the Young\". However, after the tour supporting the latter album ended in 1991, Taylor left the band in early 1992, citing exhaustion and a desire to write and get involved with other projects. Throughout the 1990s, Taylor immersed himself in numerous other projects, perhaps the most prolific of which was recording and touring with Steve Perry for his 1994 solo album.\n\nIn 1998, he returned to the Alice Cooper band (this time, alongside fellow former Winger guitarist Reb Beach), and once that tour ended, he embarked on a brief tour with Tommy Shaw. Winger reunited in 2001 to record new material for a \"Greatest Hits\" album. Although it is unclear whether Taylor participated in these recording sessions, he did later join the band on the supporting tour. Though Paul was asked by Kip Winger to rejoin the band again to work on their 2006 reunion album, he declined because he was already involved with other projects.\n\nMore recently, Taylor has become involved in composing music for television series programs and has also been pursuing his passion for photography. He also spent the summer months of 2012 touring with Cinderella throughout the U.S. playing keyboards for them. He returned to Winger during mid-2013 and performed with them on select tour dates up through early 2014 and appeared in the Queen Babylon released in late 2014.",

A graduate of St. Joseph's College in Memramcook and the New Brunswick Teachers' College in Fredericton, Lévesque taught school before entering political life. A resident of Edmundston, New Brunswick, he was first elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 1960 New Brunswick general election as a Liberal Party candidate for one of the three seats for Madawaska County. He was reelected in 1963, 1967, and 1970. In the 1974 election, he lost by 95 votes to the Progressive Conservative candidate Jean-Pierre Ouellet in the newly created riding of Madawaska-les-Lacs. Without the Parti Acadien contesting the riding, Lévesque may have won; the Parti Acadien received 99 votes, ones that are generally accepted as being traditional Liberal supporters. Lévesque attempted a political comeback in the City of Edmundston riding in 1982 but lost to Jean-Maurice Simard.\n\nAs a member of the Legislative Assembly in the government of Premier Louis Robichaud, Lévesque was an ardent defender of Francophone rights and was one of the first members to give his speeches in the Assembly in the French language. Out of politics, in 1990 the Government of Canada appointed him to diplomatic missions abroad which organized and supervised democratic elections in 10 African countries, in two countries from the former Soviet Union, as well as in Bosnia and Herzegovina.",

    "evidence": "Lieutenant Junior Grade Tetsuzō Iwamoto was one of the top-scoring aces among the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force (IJNAF) fighter pilots. He entered the Imperial Navy in 1934 and completed pilot training in December 1936. His first combat occurred over China in early 1938, and he emerged as the top naval ace of the campaign, credited with 14 aerial victories. Subsequently, he flew Zeros from the aircraft carrier Zuikaku from December 1941 to May 1942, including at the Battle of the Coral Sea. In late 1943, Iwamoto's air group was sent to Rabaul, New Britain, resulting in three months of the hardest air combat ever undertaken by the IJNAF against air raids mounted by U.S. and Allied air units. Subsequent assignments were Truk Atoll in the Carolines and the Philippines, and he was commissioned an Ensign in October 1944. Following the evacuation of the Philippines, Iwamoto served in home defense and trained Kamikaze pilots. Like many Japanese veterans, Iwamoto was reported to have fallen into depression after the war. His diary was found after his death, with claims of 202 Allied aircraft destroyed. As a result of the Japanese use of the British naval practices, the IJNAF scoring system was based on the system the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force (RAF) adopted from World War I until World War II. This system differed from the scoring system used by the U.S. Navy Air Force and U.S. Marine Air Force during World War II. Dr. Izawa and Professor Hata estimated the figure at about 80 or more than 87 in their research work in January 1971. In December 1993, Izawa wrote that Iwamoto was \"virtually\" the top ace of the IJNAF. As of mid-1944, there remained only two IJNAF fighter pilots who were credited with over 100 victories. Depending on various totals cited, Tetsuzō Iwamoto or Hiroyoshi Nishizawa was Japan's best ace. Iwamoto was known as the Chūtai leader (flying company, squadron of 8 to 16 fighters). Iwamoto was one of few survivors of the IJNAF from the early part of the Second World War. He fought over the Indian and the Pacific Ocean from north to south, and trained his young pilots even in the last months of the war.",

In 1817, he received his doctorate from the University of Würzburg, and spent several years (1827–1842) performing scientific research from his estate in Carnikava (on the banks of the Gauja River near Riga). In 1820, he took part in a scientific expedition to Bokhara as a naturalist. In 1826, he became a member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Pander studied the chick embryo and discovered the germ layers (i.e., three distinct regions of the embryo that give rise to the specific organ system). Because of these findings, he is considered by many to be the \"founder of embryology\". His work in embryology was continued by Karl Ernst von Baer (1792–1876), who expanded Pander's concept of germ layers to include all vertebrates. Pander performed important studies in the field of paleontology, being known for his extensive research on fossils found in the Devonian and Silurian geological strata of the Baltic regions. His study of trilobites from this age led to the adjective \"Panderian\", first used by the Canadian palaeontologist Elkanah Billings. Pander is credited as the first scientist to describe primitive creatures known as conodonts. Today, the Pander Society is an international association of palaeontologists and stratigraphers with a common interest in the study of conodonts. He died in Saint Petersburg.",

King Zhuang ascended the throne in 613 BC at a time when the kingdom of Chu was in disarray. For the first three years of his reign, Zhuang wasted time on excessive hunting and lavish partying. Several courtiers were anxious about the king, but none dared speak up as he had given orders that anyone who challenged his authority would be killed. When a particularly senior minister challenged him through a riddle, the king responded that he had been waiting for three years for someone from his court to show some nationalistic pride. The king made Sunshu Ao chancellor and began a series of reforms. Chu's agricultural output improved significantly during his reign, aided by Sunshu Ao's comprehensive dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir created in modern-day northern Anhui province. In 611 BC he annexed the state of Yong (庸国), a move which made Chu much stronger. After some overwhelming victories at the head of his army, King Zhuang attempted to take the place of King Ding of Zhou. He asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the nine tripod cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China at the time, but was rebuffed. In the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the state of Jin, another strong state at that time. Later he achieved hegemony amongst some other states. His progress from lazy regent to a hegemon of his time gave rise to the Chinese four-character idiom of \"Yī Mǐng Jīng Rén\" (一冥而惊人).",

    "evidence": "George John Kurowski (April 19, 1918 – December 9, 1999) was a third baseman in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the St. Louis Cardinals (1949). Kurowski batted and threw right-handed. He debuted on September 23, 1941, and played his final game on October 1, 1949. In a nine-season career, Kurowski posted a .286 batting average with 106 home runs and 529 RBI in 916 games played. Kurowski's childhood nickname came from his already white hair. A native of Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski overcame several personal problems. He overcame childhood osteomyelitis, which made him miss a part of a bone on his right forearm. Before he started his baseball career, his older brother died in a mine accident, and his father died from a heart attack during spring training in 1942. His most productive season came in 1945, when he posted career-highs in average (.310), home runs (27), RBI (104), runs (108), doubles (27), slugging percentage (.544) and on-base percentage (.420). An All-Star during five consecutive seasons (1943–47), Kurowski exceeded the 20 home run mark three times to set a major league record for a third baseman (1944–45, 1947), and hit over .300 three times (1945–47). He also led the National League three times in putouts, twice in fielding percentage, and once in double plays. In four World Series appearances, Kurowski hit .253 (21-for-83) with one home run and nine RBI in 23 games, as the Cardinals were world champions in 1942, 1944 and 1946. His only home run in the series, in 1942, off Red Ruffing, broke a 2–2 tie in the ninth inning of Game Five to clinch the title for St. Louis over the New York Yankees. He also appeared five times in the MVP ballot, in 1942 and from 1944 through 1947. In 1949, Kurowski developed arm and elbow problems and his playing career ended. After that, he coached and managed in the minor leagues for 18 years until 1972. He gained induction into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame in 1988. In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \"All-Time All-Star Argument Starter,\" consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Kurowski was the third baseman on Stein's Polish team. Kurowski died in Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania, at age 81.",

    "evidence": "Twila Shively (March 20, 1920 – November 25, 1999) was an American competitive baseball player. An outfielder, she played from 1945 through 1950 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5'2\", 128 lb., she batted and threw right-handed. Shively spent five of her six years in the AAGPBL playing in the left field. A solid defensive player, she showed speed, good hands, an accurate throwing arm, and lived in a constant state of readiness. Routinely, she ranked among the top defensive outfielders in several categories, until a severe ankle injury limited her ability to perform, and she had to switch to first base. Offensively, she made consistent contact, knew when to take the extra base, and excelled as a basestealer.\n\nBorn in Decatur, Illinois, Twila Shively was the daughter of Glenn and Eva (née Bryant) Shively. She began playing softball at age eight and moved up in the softball ranks in Chicago as early as 1942. By then, she was featured in an article signed by Carl Guldager and published in the Chicago Daily News with the headline: \"She's Hedy Lamarr of Softball, Twila Shively Looks Like Model, Runs Bases Like Ty Cobb. Has Baseball Savvy Plus Pretty Face\". In 1944, Shively became a member of the Rockola Chicks team of the newly formed National Girls Baseball League. The NGBL was organized in Chicago to keep the best local players from migrating to the AAGPBL, which had been stabilized in 1943. After that, both circuits competed against each other to see who could associate itself with the biggest stars.\n\nShively entered the AAGPBL in 1945 with the Grand Rapids Chicks, playing for them three years before joining the Chicago Colleens (1948) and Peoria Redwings (1948–1950). In her rookie year, she formed part of a Chicks outfield that included Thelma Eisen in the center field and Elizabeth Wicken at right field. Shively collected a .196 batting average and a .276 on-base percentage in 106 games, driving in 23 runs and scoring 42 times, while her 46 stolen bases ranked her fifth in the league. She also led all outfielders with a .968 fielding percentage and finished second for the most putouts (234) behind Fort Wayne Daisies' Penny O'Brian (236). During the regular season, she achieved a career highlight, when she belted a two-out, walk-off grand slam to give her team the victory.\n\nHer most productive season came in 1946, when she posted career numbers in average (.247), runs scored (78), hits (101), runs batted in (45), steals (45), and games played (111). Considering the year was great for many pitchers, her numbers were quite respectable. Four no-hitters were recorded by Anna Mae Hutchison (Belles), Betty Luna (Blue Sox), Carolyn Morris (Peaches), and Amy Irene Applegren (Lassies), while Connie Wisniewski (Chicks) and Dorothy Wiltse (Daisies) topped the league in earned run average with 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. As a result, more than half of the circuit's players averaged under .200. Dorothy Kamenshek (Peaches) was the only hitter to reach the .300 mark (.316).\n\nFollowing her baseball career, Shively graduated from Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and worked as a physical education teacher at Washington High School in South Bend, Indiana. She also coached the school's softball and volleyball teams to city championships, inspiring children for almost 30 years. Twila Shively died in Douglas, Michigan on Thanksgiving Day, 1999 at the age of 79, after suffering four years of Alzheimer's disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer. She is part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, unveiled in 1988, which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual personality.",

    "evidence": "Nate Saint (August 30, 1923 - January 8, 1956) was an evangelical Christian missionary pilot to Ecuador who, along with four others, was killed while attempting to evangelize the Huaorani people through efforts known as Operation Auca. Nate Saint was born in 1923. When he was seven, he took his first plane ride with his brother Sam, who would eventually become a commercial pilot for American Airlines. While in the airplane, he discovered a love of flying. His family was somewhat unusual; his brothers made a sleeping patio on the roof of their home, and his dad built a roller coaster in the backyard.\n\nWhen he joined the army, he was stationed in Las Vegas, NV, but was transferred to several other locations over the years. A leg injury from a sledding accident caused him some problems while he was in the army. About a year before he was discharged, he almost died while climbing a mountain in Yosemite National Park. After that incident, he learned to live life to the fullest.\n\nIn September 1955, Nate was joined by his teammates, Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Pete Fleming, and Roger Youderian. Saint finally found a settlement of the Huaorani, also known as Aucas, while searching by air. To reach the tribe, Saint and the team lowered gifts to the Huaorani in a bucket tied to the plane. The Huaorani were widely feared by other Ecuadoreans, because they combined a desire to be left alone with a willingness to use force; they attacked and killed any intruders without provocation. Nevertheless, the tribe was excited on receiving the gifts and gave some gifts back.\n\nFinally, the missionaries decided to try to meet the Huaorani on the ground; and, on January 3, 1956, using the beach as a landing strip, they set up camp four miles from the Huaorani settlement. Their initial contact was encouraging; however, on Sunday, January 8, 1956, the entire team was killed on the beach (known as \"Palm Beach\") when armed Huaorani met and speared them.\n\nSaint and the other four men became famous worldwide as a result. \"Life\" magazine published a 10-page photo essay on the story, which was also covered in Reader's Digest and many other publications. Today, a small school for missionary children in Shell, Ecuador, bears Nate Saint's name. Rachel Saint, Nate's sister, continued the mission efforts to the Huaorani, which eventually came to fruition. This resulted in many of these natives becoming Christians, including those who had killed Saint.\n\nIn 1966, Marjorie (Marj) Farris Saint married Abe Van Der Puy, president of HCJB World Radio. Abe died in 2003; and Marj died in 2004, from cancer. She is buried in Hillcrest Memorial Gardens, south of Ocala, Florida. Nate's older son, Steve Saint, spent time as a child visiting his missionary family members and friends and getting to know the Huaorani. Steve was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ by Mincaye, who was the very man who killed his father but later converted to Christ. Steve Saint now works with the Huaorani people and travels around the world, preaching the gospel, often accompanied by Mincaye.\n\nA documentary based on the story, \"Through the Gates of Splendor\", was released in 2005. The following year, a feature film, \"End of the Spear\", was released on January 20, a week and a half after the 50-year anniversary of the killings. Steve Saint also helped write \"Jungle Pilot\", based on his father's diary about his time in Ecuador and work with the Huaorani Indians.",

When guitarist-songwriter Ron Elliott was putting the band together in 1964, he asked a friend, Kay Dane, if she knew any good bass players. Dane recommended Meagher, but cautioned, \"He's kind of weird. He has long hair!\" After joining the band, Meagher proved to be important to the band's image, as he was one of the first American rock musicians with Beatlesque hair. In addition to providing backing vocals, Meagher sang lead on occasion, as on \"They'll Make You Cry,\" a song from the band's 1965 debut album, Introducing the Beau Brummels. Meagher appeared with the band in the 1965 science-fiction/comedy movie Village of the Giants, which was featured in a 1994 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. He remained with the band as it reduced from a quintet to a trio by 1967's critically acclaimed album Triangle. During the recording of the band's next album, 1968's Bradley's Barn, Meagher was drafted, becoming one of the few musicians from a well-known rock band to serve in the military at the height of the Vietnam War. After he was discharged two years later, Meagher played in the Black Velvet Band with former Beau Brummels bandmate Declan Mulligan. Over the next three decades, Meagher has also participated in several Beau Brummels revivals, most notably in the mid-1970s when the band released a 1975 self-titled reunion album.",

    "evidence": "Mackenzie Caquatto (born March 26, 1992) is an American artistic gymnast. She was formerly on the US National Team. Her younger sister, Bridgette Caquatto, was also an elite gymnast on the senior US National Team. She first qualified as an elite gymnast in 2007 and competed at the 2007 US National Championships, where she finished 17th. Mackenzie competed as a senior for the first time at the 2008 US National Championships and placed 10th overall. She was selected to be a member of her first national team and qualified for the 2008 US Olympic Team Trials, but competed only on the first day of competition, placing 12th in the all-around on that day.\n\nIn 2009, Caquatto competed at her first international meets as a member of the national team. Caquatto suffered a knee injury shortly after, but managed to place 5th at the 2009 US National Championships. She was then invited to the World Championships Selection Camp and was named as the first alternate for the team. In addition to her status as an alternate, she was sent to the Toyota International in Toyota City, Japan. At this competition, she competed on the uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise, winning the silver medal on the uneven bars with a score of 14.675, only behind world silver medalist on the event, Koko Tsurumi of Japan.\n\nCaquatto started her 2010 season by competing at the City of Jesolo Trophy, where she had the highest beam score but made mistakes on the floor which kept her from medaling in the all-around. Caquatto competed at the 2010 CoverGirl Classic and placed 3rd in the all-around, scoring the second highest on vault and the uneven bars but falling from the balance beam. She had qualified to compete at the 2010 US National Championships. At the 2010 US National Championships, Mackenzie placed 5th in the all-around. She fell on a simple change grip skill on the uneven bars, her best event, placing 4th. After the US Nationals, Mackenzie was selected to attend a selection camp for the 2010 World Championships. From there, she advanced to the second camp where she won the all-around competition. She was eventually selected to compete.\n\nAt the World Championships, Mackenzie competed in the all-around in the qualifying round. After hitting all her routines without major error, she placed 9th individually and 3rd with the team. Although the top 24 qualifiers advance to the individual all-around final, she was left out because fellow American athletes Aly Raisman and Rebecca Bross had qualified ahead of her and only two athletes from each country can qualify to a final. After the qualifying round, Mackenzie was selected to compete on the uneven bars and the vault during the team finals. She contributed a 14.666 on the bars and a 15.000 on the vault to help the team win the silver medal behind Russia and ahead of China.\n\nShe competed as a Florida Gator at the NCAA level for the 2010–2011 season, where she became injured but still competed in the all-around for her team at the NCAA Championships. After finishing the NCAA season, Mackenzie decided to train for a comeback to elite gymnastics for the 2011 season. Mackenzie began her 2011 elite season by competing at the CoverGirl Classic. At the classic, she competed a slightly watered down balance beam routine and a solid uneven bars routine, scoring 14.100 and 14.750, respectively.\n\nAt the 2011 US Visa National Championships, Mackenzie surprised many by competing in the all-around. On day 1 of the competition, Mackenzie was in second place after the two rotations; after scoring a 14.700 and 15.000 on vault and uneven bars, respectively. Unfortunately, she counted her first fall on the balance beam. After having a solid floor exercise, she finished her night in sixth place with an all-around score of 56.000. On the final day of competition, Mackenzie competed solidly on all her events. Taking advantage of injuries to defending national champion Rebecca Bross and Chellsie Memmel, Mackenzie went on to finish the championships in fourth place behind Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, and champion Jordyn Wieber. She also took second place on the uneven bars just behind Wieber by 0.050.\n\nMackenzie was given a spot on her fourth national team and was invited to compete at the first World Team Selection Camp. She was considered to be a likely pick for the World Team, but injured her ankles when dismounting the beam at the selection camp and therefore lost her chance of going to Tokyo. After sitting out the beginning of the NCAA season, she competed on the uneven bars in early 2012 and is expected to reintroduce her beam routine soon.",

He later served as Carlton vice-president and club secretary. He is the centre half back in Carlton's official 'Team of the Century'.

    "evidence": "Lieutenant Junior Grade Tetsuzō Iwamoto was one of the top-scoring aces among the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force (IJNAF) fighter pilots. He entered the Imperial Navy in 1934 and completed pilot training in December 1936. His first combat occurred over China in early 1938, and he emerged as the top naval ace of the campaign, credited with 14 aerial victories. Subsequently, he flew Zeros from the aircraft carrier Zuikaku from December 1941 to May 1942, including at the Battle of the Coral Sea. In late 1943, Iwamoto's air group was sent to Rabaul, New Britain, resulting in three months of the hardest air combat ever undertaken by the IJNAF against air raids mounted by U.S. and Allied air units. Subsequent assignments were Truk Atoll in the Carolines and the Philippines, and he was commissioned an Ensign in October 1944. Following the evacuation of the Philippines, Iwamoto served in home defense and trained Kamikaze pilots. Like many Japanese veterans, Iwamoto was reported to have fallen into depression after the war. His diary was found after his death, with claims of 202 Allied aircraft destroyed. As a result of the Japanese use of the British naval practices, the IJNAF scoring system was based on the system the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force (RAF) adopted from World War I until World War II. This system differed from the scoring system used by the U.S. Navy Air Force and U.S. Marine Air Force during World War II. Dr. Izawa and Professor Hata estimated the figure at about 80 or more than 87 in their research work in January 1971. In December 1993, Izawa wrote that Iwamoto was \"virtually\" the top ace of the IJNAF. As of mid-1944, there remained only two IJNAF fighter pilots who were credited with over 100 victories. Depending on various totals cited, Tetsuzō Iwamoto or Hiroyoshi Nishizawa was Japan's best ace. Iwamoto was known as the Chūtai leader (flying company, squadron of 8 to 16 fighters). Iwamoto was one of few survivors of the IJNAF from the early part of the Second World War. He fought over the Indian and the Pacific Ocean from north to south, and trained his young pilots even in the last months of the war.",

    "evidence": "Geoffrey Merton \"Geoff\" Griffin (12 June 1939 - 16 November 2006) was a cricketer who played two Tests for South Africa in 1960. In his second Test appearance in 1960 at Lord's, he became the first (and, as of November 2014, only) South African cricketer to take a hat-trick in a Test match, and also the first and only cricketer to take a Test hat-trick at Lord's. He is best known for being no-balled for throwing in his second Test and the exhibition match that followed, and he never played Test cricket again.\n\nGriffin was born in Greytown in the former Natal Province and was educated at Durban High School. He was tall and blond, and excelled in many sports, playing hockey for Rhodesia and under-19s rugby for Natal. He was also Natal champion in the high jump, long jump, triple jump and pole vault. Griffin suffered an accident in childhood which rendered him unable to straighten his right arm.\n\nThere was continuing controversy about bowlers \"throwing\" or \"chucking\" the ball (that is, flexing their elbow in the action of bowling the ball, which is contrary to the laws of cricket). The issue had been controversial since the editor of Wisden, Sydney Pardon, claimed that Australian fast bowler Ernest Jones was throwing in the tour of England in 1896, and then Jones and C. B. Fry were both no-balled in the Melbourne Test in 1897. The issue achieved renewed prominence following the Ashes series in Australia in 1958-59, when Australians Ian Meckiff and Gordon Rorke were suspected of throwing. Other fast bowlers, such as West Indies' Charlie Griffith and New Zealand's Gary Bartlett were also suspected. The MCC was determined to stamp out the problem before the Ashes series in England in 1961, and English umpires were instructed to strictly enforce the rule against throwing in 1960.\n\nGriffin made his first-class cricket debut for Natal in the 1957-58 South African domestic season, as a fast bowler. Despite being no-balled in South African provincial matches in the 1959-60 season, Griffin finished at the top of the averages, with 35 wickets at a bowling average of 12.23, and was selected to tour England in 1960, aged 20. Griffin was no-balled 8 times during the tour match against the MCC at Lord's in May 1960, the first time that a touring player was called for throwing, and no-balled again several times by various umpires in matches against the counties. He tried to change his action at Alf Gover's indoor school, and was not called once in the 42 overs that he bowled in the 1st Test at Edgbaston, although his pace was much reduced. In the search for quicker deliveries, he fell back into his old faults, and was called in a tour match against Hampshire. English umpires Frank Lee and Syd Buller repeatedly called Geoff Griffin for throwing in the 2nd Test, at Lord's, starting from his third over.\n\nAfter being no-balled 5 times on the first day and 6 times on the second day, he returned for a final bowling spell on Saturday 25 June and dismissed M. J. K. Smith with the last ball of one over, caught behind by John Waite for 99, and then bowled Peter Walker and Fred Trueman with the first two balls of his next over. This was the first Test cricket hat-trick claimed by a South African cricketer. England immediately declared their first innings for 362 with 8 wickets down. England quickly dismissed South Africa twice to win by an innings and 73 runs, just after lunch on the fourth day, Monday 27 June, with Brian Statham taking 6-62 and 5-34.\n\nA 20-over exhibition match was arranged to fill the period until the scheduled presentation of the players to the Queen at tea. Griffin was again repeatedly no-balled in the exhibition match for throwing, and was also no-balled for failing to notify the umpires that he was changing to bowl underarm to complete an over. Griffin later recounted that Donald Bradman came to the dressing room to console him, and let him know that the umpires were acting on order from MCC President Gubby Allen. Griffin remained on the tour as a batsman, but never played Test cricket again.\n\nMany spectators could see no difference between his \"legitimate\" deliveries, and the ones that were no-balled: many concluded that he threw every delivery. The public saw him as a martyr and scapegoat, and he was warmly applauded by the spectators at all of his subsequent tour matches. None of the controversial Australian bowlers from the 1958-59 Ashes series toured England in 1961. He moved to play for Rhodesia, but his cricket career ended less than 2 years later, at the age of 23, after he was no-balled playing in a Currie Cup match against North Eastern Transvaal at Salisbury.\n\nIn retirement from cricket, he played club cricket, was a cricket coach, and worked as a hotel manager for South African Breweries in Durban, at the Argyll, and then at the Congela Hotel. He married twice. Griffin died of a heart attack in Durban.",

Amongst other achievements, he established a dynasty of prominent ecclesiastics and literary figures closely integrated into the Protestant squirearchy in the west of Ireland. He died in office on 23 July 1741, aged 82. His sons were Edward Synge (Bishop of Elphin) and Nicholas Synge (Bishop of Killaloe).",

    "claim": "Reynolds was a prolific author, writing on a wide range of topics.",
    "evidence": "Sir John Russell Reynolds, 1st Baronet (22 May 1828 – 29 May 1896) was a British neurologist and physician. Reynolds was born in Romsey, Hampshire, as the son of John Reynolds, an independent minister, and the grandson of Dr. Henry Revell Reynolds. He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851, he graduated M.B. in the University of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852, he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a Fellow of the College in 1859. In the same year, he was appointed Assistant Physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 Assistant Physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865, he became Professor of the Principles and Practice of Medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen's Household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 Vice-President of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian Lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian Oration in 1884, and was elected President in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a Baronet. In the winter of 1895–96, he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as President of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children. The \"Reynolds Baronetcy\", of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death. Reynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an \"Essay on Vertigo\"; in 1855 \"Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves\", as well as \"Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain\"; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 \"Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity\"; in 1872 \"The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity\"; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the \"System of Medicine\", in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write – compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a \"Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe\". Reynolds was a tall man, with dark hair, with a dignified delivery and some oratorical power. Reynolds died in London.",

Dane recommended Meagher, but cautioned, \"He's kind of weird.

In addition to providing backing vocals, Meagher sang lead on occasion, as on \"They'll Make You Cry,\" a song from the band's 1965 debut album, Introducing the Beau Brummels. Meagher appeared with the band in the 1965 science-fiction/comedy movie Village of the Giants, which was featured in a 1994 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. He remained with the band as it reduced from a quintet to a trio by 1967's critically acclaimed album Triangle.

After he was discharged two years later, Meagher played in the Black Velvet Band with former Beau Brummels bandmate Declan Mulligan. Over the next three decades, Meagher has also participated in several Beau Brummels revivals, most notably in the mid-1970s when the band released a 1975 self-titled reunion album.",

He was born on December 14 in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania (now a part of Pittsburgh), the son of Delia Dennig Hubbard and Dewitt Clinton Clapp, an iron company executive. He graduated from the Western University of Pennsylvania (today's University of Pittsburgh) in 1877. He married Anne Love in 1882 and the couple had two children. Clapp took an engineering position at Park Brothers' Black Diamond Steel Works. There, along with Captain Alfred E. Hunt, he established the Pittsburgh Testing Laboratory's chemistry department. Hunt formed a company in 1888 to exploit the Charles Martin Hall patents for making aluminum by electrolysis. Clapp was treasurer and secretary of the fledgling company. He resigned as treasurer in 1892 and was replaced by Andrew W. Mellon. The company later became known as the Aluminium Company of America. While Hall is generally credited with the invention of the aluminum process, Clapp raised the initial venture capital to make the process commercially viable; the Mellon interests supplied the company's working capital.\n\nAs Clapp's wealth grew, he pursued his avocational interests in conchology and numismatics. He had begun collecting coins as a boy in the 1870s by sifting through the coins of a toll bridge across the Allegheny River. He later became a founder of the Western Pennsylvania Numismatic Society. His grandfather encouraged him to start collecting shells; over the years he assembled more than 100,000 mollusk shells, which he later donated to the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. In the 1930s he donated his coin collections to both the American Numismatic Society and the Carnegie.\n\nBeginning in 1907 until his death, Clapp was president of Pitt's Board of Trustees. He was a driving force in moving the school from its North Side location to the Oakland district. He also was a trustee of the Carnegie Institute of Technology (today's Carnegie Mellon University) and a member of the American Chemical Society. He died at age 90 on March 31, 1949 at his home in Sewickley, Pennsylvania. Clapp Hall, an academic building on the Pitt campus, is named in his honor.",

    "evidence": "C.V. Ananda Bose is an Indian civil servant who served in the Indian Administrative Service. He is notable for not yielding to the corrupt system of the Indian bureaucracy. An eminent administrator, writer, orator, and innovator, Dr. C.V. Ananda Bose pioneered pathbreaking administrative innovations in rural development, affordable housing, eco-tourism development, redressal of public grievances, women's empowerment, development of weaker sections of society, and promotion of art and culture. The innovations have found expression in various developmental programmes that have been executed at the district, state, and national levels in India.\n\nIt was in the area of low-cost housing that Dr. Bose pioneered a movement that won international acclaim. He set up the first Nirmithi Kendra (building centre) in the country in the Kollam district, which became the institutional mechanism for the propagation of cost-effective, environment-friendly (CEEF) building technology. This was positively evaluated by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Government of India (1993). Based on the Kollam model, the Government of India launched the National Building Centre Movement to replicate Nirmithi Kendras (building centres) in every district of the country. The Nirmithi Movement was adjudged by the United Nations as one of the global best practices in the field of sustainable human settlement development.\n\nEarly in his career, Dr. Bose introduced the \"Gramotsava\" programme in Kerala, wherein the local people were encouraged to actively participate in the village development planning. The initiative, launched in the Kasargode district of Kerala in the 1980s, was subsequently implemented in 200 panchayats across the state. Dr. Bose also founded the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in the Kollam district during his tenure as Collector. The Council generated high tourism interest in the region and created new job opportunities for the local people. The Government of Kerala subsequently set up similar councils in all 14 districts of the state. DTPs have made perceptible contributions in positioning Kerala as \"God's own country\".\n\nHe later pioneered an eco-village programme in the Mannanan village of the Kottayam district of Kerala, wherein the family clusters were encouraged to pursue activities such as organic farming, soil and water conservation through traditional methods, floriculture, horticulture, vermiculture, generation of energy from non-conventional sources, homestead forestry, etc., with institutional support, governmental assistance, and financial support from different agencies.\n\nAs Chairman of the Atomic Energy Education Society, Mumbai, Dr. Bose introduced and reinforced the concept of alternative education, wherein people could pursue studies in disciplines in which they did not have prior academic backgrounds. He founded the Institute of Alternative Education. He also launched the ASTER Project (Application of Science & Technology in Educational Reforms) which sought to alter the mode of academic delivery through the application of information and communication technology (ICT).\n\nAs Managing Director of NAFED, Dr. Bose initiated a few innovative programmes which helped control the price spiral during 2009-10. Christened as \"Farm Gate to Home Gate\", this innovation sought to buy agricultural produce directly from the farmers for distribution among the consumers, taking only marginal profit. Spurred by the success of this pilot programme in New Delhi, the Easy Market Scheme was envisaged for price control in the rest of the country.\n\nAs the administrator of the National Museum, Dr. Bose launched a 100-day programme which spelt out specific measures to revamp and revitalise the institution. Most of the improvements suggested were achieved in 60 days, such as opening the closed-down galleries, modernising the display and lighting, launching outreach programmes to take the museum to the community, arranging children's programmes to ignite young minds to the greatness of India's national heritage, organising international exhibitions, and launching the People's Museum Movement, to mention a few.\n\nPursuit of excellence was always central to Dr. Bose's role in public administration. His contributions were seldom circumscribed by the call of duty. Instead, he has been engaged in continuous research and field experimentation in developing the most appropriate, people-first solutions. He also took key steps to synergise the various government programmes and schemes to create comprehensive, sustainable, and inclusive administrative mechanisms that have since been replicated in multiple domains.\n\nIn recognition of this remarkable turnaround of the museum management and the perceptible makeover of the institution, the Government of India asked Dr. Bose to continue with this mission even after his retirement from service.",

He escaped and lived with an Italian family as their \"son\". In 1989, he published an autobiography, \"Family of Four\", which described these experiences. Baird returned to Aberdeen before the end of the war. His good form in this period earned him selection for Scotland in a friendly match against Belgium in early 1946. Baird was one of nine Scotland players making their international debut in the match, with only Jimmy Delaney having significant experience. Of those nine debutants, five players did not make another international appearance, including Baird. Baird helped Aberdeen win the Southern League Cup (a forerunner of the Scottish League Cup) in 1946 and the 1947 Scottish Cup, but his appearances were restricted by injuries. In all, he made 104 league appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 26 goals in those matches. He was transferred in 1953 to St. Johnstone, where he played for three seasons before retiring in 1956. After retiring as a player, Baird worked as a teacher and a sports journalist. Baird celebrated his 90th birthday in May 2009, and died quietly in his sleep on 3 November 2009.",

His personal name was Xiong Lü, ancestral name Mi (芈), and King Zhuang was his posthumous title. He became one of the Five Hegemons and attempted to wrest control of China from the King of Zhou. King Zhuang ascended the throne in 613 BC at a time when the kingdom of Chu was in disarray. For the first three years of his reign, Zhuang wasted time on excessive hunting and lavish partying. Several courtiers were anxious about the king, but none dared speak up as he had given orders that anyone who challenged his authority would be killed. When a particularly senior minister challenged him through a riddle, the king responded that he had been waiting for three years for someone from his court to show some nationalistic pride. The king made Sunshu Ao chancellor and began a series of reforms. Chu's agricultural output improved significantly during his reign, aided by Sunshu Ao's comprehensive dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir created in modern-day northern Anhui province. In 611 BC he annexed the state of Yong (庸国), a move which made Chu much stronger. After some overwhelming victories at the head of his army, King Zhuang attempted to take the place of King Ding of Zhou. He asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the nine tripod cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China at the time, but was rebuffed. In the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the state of Jin, another strong state at that time. Later he achieved hegemony amongst some other states. His progress from lazy regent to a hegemon of his time gave rise to the Chinese four-character idiom of \"Yī Mǐng Jīng Rén\" (一冥而惊人).",

Although he is perhaps most frequently associated with Winger, Taylor has also played with numerous other prominent musicians, including future Sammy Hagar and Boston guitarist Gary Pihl (in his early days), Eric Martin (solo artist and future Mr. Big frontman), Aldo Nova, Steve Perry of Journey, Alice Cooper, and Tommy Shaw.\n\nTaylor experienced his first mainstream success in the early 1980s as the touring keyboardist in Canadian musician Aldo Nova's backing band, and he appears in the music video for Nova's biggest hit, \"Fantasy.\" Prior to forming Winger, Taylor and Kip Winger were both playing with Alice Cooper's backing band on the tours for Cooper's mid-80s albums, \"Constrictor\" (1986) and \"Raise Your Fist and Yell\" (1987). During this time, the two began composing songs together and, while on break from touring, recorded what would become the first Winger demos. Whereas Kip left Alice's band prior to the European leg of the 1987 tour, Paul remained on board for the European dates. However, in the midst of touring Europe, Paul received a call from Kip, who had been working with future Winger lead guitarist Reb Beach recording more demos in New York, informing him that he had gotten a record deal. After the European tour was finished, Paul flew straight back to New York, and the Winger project (initially known as \"Sahara\") began rehearsing and recording their debut album.\n\nTaylor remained in Winger throughout the band's most successful period, which included the two smash albums, \"Winger\" and \"In the Heart of the Young\". However, after the tour supporting the latter album ended in 1991, Taylor left the band in early 1992, citing exhaustion and a desire to write and get involved with other projects. Throughout the 1990s, Taylor immersed himself in numerous other projects, perhaps the most prolific of which was recording and touring with Steve Perry for his 1994 solo album.\n\nIn 1998, he returned to the Alice Cooper band (this time, alongside fellow former Winger guitarist Reb Beach), and once that tour ended, he embarked on a brief tour with Tommy Shaw. Winger reunited in 2001 to record new material for a \"Greatest Hits\" album. Although it is unclear whether Taylor participated in these recording sessions, he did later join the band on the supporting tour. Though Paul was asked by Kip Winger to rejoin the band again to work on their 2006 reunion album, he declined because he was already involved with other projects.\n\nMore recently, Taylor has become involved in composing music for television series programs and has also been pursuing his passion for photography. He also spent the summer months of 2012 touring with Cinderella throughout the U.S. playing keyboards for them. He returned to Winger during mid-2013 and performed with them on select tour dates up through early 2014 and appeared in the Queen Babylon released in late 2014.",

Cushnahan was educated at St Mary's Christian Brothers Grammar School and Queen's University, Belfast, and worked as a teacher before going into politics. He worked as General Secretary of the Alliance Party from 1974 until 1982 and was a member of Belfast City Council between 1977 and 1985. In 1982, he was elected to the prior Assembly for North Down and two years later he became the new leader of Alliance, succeeding Oliver Napier. During his tenure as leader, he sought to strengthen the party's links with the British Liberal Party. The Anglo Irish Agreement was signed during this period and Cushnahan faced the difficult position of giving Alliance support to it and facing the united opposition of the Unionist parties. However, when the Assembly was dissolved in 1986, Cushnahan found it financially difficult to remain in politics and so stood down as leader in 1987 to be succeeded by John Alderdice. Two years later, Cushnahan made a surprise political comeback when he moved to the Republic of Ireland and stood as a Fine Gael candidate in the 1989 election to the European Parliament, winning a seat in the Munster constituency. He was an MEP for fifteen years before retiring at the 2004 elections. Cushnahan now serves as a board member of the peace and reconciliation charity Co-operation Ireland.",

Mr. Hsu was born on the island of Gulangyu in southeast China. As the youngest son of a Christian pastor, he grew up singing hymns while his mother played on an upright piano. One day, when his mother was ill, the five-year-old Fei-Ping went to the piano and played the hymns by ear. The family realized his tremendous talent and encouraged him to study music. When he was eight years old, he had a rare opportunity to meet Professor Ji-Sen Fan, the head of the piano department of the Shanghai Conservatory, and was recognized as a child prodigy. By the time he was twelve, he already played the complete Chopin Etudes and had performed with the Shanghai Philharmonic.\n\nFeiping was invited to perform for Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, who was so impressed with his ability that she personally invited Fei-Ping to study and perform in Europe under her sponsorship. Unfortunately, he was not allowed to accept this invitation due to the advent of the Cultural Revolution during the 1960s. However, he survived the labor camps and became well known in China, touring extensively throughout the Far East as a soloist with the Central Philharmonic, the foremost leading orchestra. He was a gold medal winner at the Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Competition, the first pianist in the competition's history from the People's Republic of China. He also garnered top prizes in other international competitions, including the Gina Bachauer Memorial Piano Scholarship Competition, the University of Maryland International Competition, and the Paloma O'Shea International Competition (Spain).\n\nMr. Hsu made his New York recital debut at Alice Tully Hall in 1983 and performed throughout the United States, including notable appearances at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. He also frequently toured Europe, South America, and the Far East. Mr. Hsu was especially noted for his larger-than-life virtuosic style of Horowitzian pianism.\n\nIn 1979, Fei-Ping Hsu received permission to study in the United States. Among others, he attended the Juilliard School of Music under the tutelage of Sascha Gorodnitzki. He had given numerous concerts in Germany, France, Andorra, Switzerland, and Italy. He has appeared as a soloist with major orchestras, including the Montreal Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Maestro Charles Dutoit, the Moscow Philharmonic in Russia, the Finnish Tempere Symphony Orchestra in Europe, as well as numerous orchestras in the United States performing in various concert halls and music festivals. Mr. Hsu was also actively engaged in his native Asia, where his collaborations include appearances with the China National Symphony Orchestra in Beijing, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the Shanghai Radio Symphony Orchestra, and the Kyushu Symphony Orchestra in Japan.\n\nSince the early 1970s, Mr. Hsu had recorded for major labels such as Columbia Records, RCA Victor Records, Hugo Records, ROI Productions, and MA Recordings in Japan. Highly regarded as one of the foremost pianists of the Western and Romantic traditions, Hsu was also an early champion of the music of the modern composer Huang An-Lun. His life was cut short in a road accident while on a concert tour in China on November 27, 2001, and he is remembered by many to this day. He is survived by his wife and daughter.",

His personal name was Xiong Lü, ancestral name Mi (芈), and King Zhuang was his posthumous title. He became one of the Five Hegemons and attempted to wrest control of China from the King of Zhou. King Zhuang ascended the throne in 613 BC at a time when the kingdom of Chu was in disarray. For the first three years of his reign, Zhuang wasted time on excessive hunting and lavish partying. Several courtiers were anxious about the king, but none dared speak up as he had given orders that anyone who challenged his authority would be killed. When a particularly senior minister challenged him through a riddle, the king responded that he had been waiting for three years for someone from his court to show some nationalistic pride. The king made Sunshu Ao chancellor and began a series of reforms. Chu's agricultural output improved significantly during his reign, aided by Sunshu Ao's comprehensive dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir created in modern-day northern Anhui province. In 611 BC he annexed the state of Yong (庸国), a move which made Chu much stronger. After some overwhelming victories at the head of his army, King Zhuang attempted to take the place of King Ding of Zhou. He asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the nine tripod cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China at the time, but was rebuffed. In the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the state of Jin, another strong state at that time. Later he achieved hegemony amongst some other states. His progress from lazy regent to a hegemon of his time gave rise to the Chinese four-character idiom of \"Yī Mǐng Jīng Rén\" (一冥而惊人).",

He graduated from the Western University of Pennsylvania (today's University of Pittsburgh) in 1877. He married Anne Love in 1882 and the couple had two children. Clapp took an engineering position at Park Brothers' Black Diamond Steel Works. There, along with Captain Alfred E. Hunt, he established the Pittsburgh Testing Laboratory's chemistry department. Hunt formed a company in 1888 to exploit the Charles Martin Hall patents for making aluminum by electrolysis. Clapp was treasurer and secretary of the fledgling company. He resigned as treasurer in 1892 and was replaced by Andrew W. Mellon. The company later became known as the Aluminium Company of America. While Hall is generally credited with the invention of the aluminum process, Clapp raised the initial venture capital to make the process commercially viable; the Mellon interests supplied the company's working capital.\n\nAs Clapp's wealth grew, he pursued his avocational interests in conchology and numismatics. He had begun collecting coins as a boy in the 1870s by sifting through the coins of a toll bridge across the Allegheny River. He later became a founder of the Western Pennsylvania Numismatic Society. His grandfather encouraged him to start collecting shells; over the years he assembled more than 100,000 mollusk shells, which he later donated to the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. In the 1930s he donated his coin collections to both the American Numismatic Society and the Carnegie.\n\nBeginning in 1907 until his death, Clapp was president of Pitt's Board of Trustees.

    "evidence": "Adamu ɓii Ardo Hassana (c. 1771 – c. 1848), more commonly known as Modibo Adamu, was a Fulani scholar and holy warrior who hailed from the Ba'en clan of Fulbe. He led a jihad into the region of Fumbina (in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria), opening the region for Fulani colonisation. As a result of Adamu's constant warring, the Fulani today make up the largest ethnic group in northern Cameroon (at more than 60% of the region's entire population, which, considering the fact that they weren't from the area, is a remarkable feat), and Islam is the dominant religion. The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region. Adamu studied in Hausaland and earned the title \"Modibo\" (\"Lettered One\") for his scholarship. Upon finishing his studies, he returned home to Gurin and learned of the jihad declared by Fulani mystic Usman dan Fodio. When he accompanied a delegation to visit Usman, the leader ordered Adamu to extend his jihad east as \"Lamido Fumbina\" (Ruler of the Southlands). Adamu raised an army and attacked Bata settlements near Gurin. He took the villages, and many more traditional Fulbe leaders and new soldiers came to his side. He next took on Mandara, the largest and best organised state in the region. He swept over several smaller settlements and eventually conquered the Mandara capital, Dulo, with ease. While his men celebrated, however, the Mandara army counterattacked and recaptured the town. Though he fought many more campaigns, Adamu now spent most of his time in Yola, which became his capital. He set about creating the administrative structure of his new state, which he named Adamawa after himself. Adamu ruled the empire, subordinate only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. Below him lay the heads of major settlements, known as Lamibe (singular: Lamido). The village formed the smallest unit of government. Upon Adamu's death in 1847, his son Muhammadu Lawal became Lamido of Adamawa. The empire was not to last, however, as colonial battles and division eventually destroyed the independent Fulani state. The conquest had long-term repercussions, however. The Fulani became the dominant ethnic group in the region, and Islam the major religion. The herdsmen altered the land to be more suitable for herding cattle, their primary pursuit. The jihad also pushed those peoples who had lived on the Adamawa Plateau south into the forest, the single most important event in the populating of southern Cameroon.",

    "evidence": "Tommy Nutter (17 April 1943 – 17 August 1992) was a British tailor, famous for reinventing the Savile Row suit in the 1960s. Born in Barmouth, Merioneth to Christopher Nutter and Dorothy (formerly Banister), he was raised in Edgware, Middlesex, where his father owned a local high street café. After the family moved to Kilburn, Nutter and his brother David attended Willesden Technical College. Nutter initially studied plumbing and then architecture, but he abandoned both aged 19 to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy. In the early 1960s, he joined traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward. After seven years, in 1969, he joined up with Edward Sexton to open \"Nutters of Savile Row\" at No. 35a Savile Row. They were financially backed by Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, managing director of the Beatles' Apple Corps Peter Brown, and lawyer James Vallance-White. The business was an immediate success, as Nutter combined traditional tailoring skills with innovative design. He designed for the Hardy Amies range, and then for the man himself. His clients included his investors, plus Sir Roy Strong, Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger and Elton John. Nutter himself was most proud of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles' album \"Abbey Road\" in 1969, he dressed three out of the four: George Harrison elected to be photographed on the road-crossing in denims.\n\nIn the 1970s, his bespoke business became less successful, but he branched out into ready-to-wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing the Savile Row brand in Japan. In 1976, Sexton bought Nutter out of the business. Nutter went to work for Kilgour French and Stanbury, managing his own workroom. Sexton continued to run Nutters of Savile Row until 1983, when Nutter returned to the Row with a ready-to-wear shop: \"Tommy Nutter, Savile Row\". (This new venture, which traded at No. 19 Savile Row until Tommy's death, was backed by J&J Crombie Limited, who continue to own the \"Tommy Nutter\" trademark.) At this time, Sexton set up a business in his own name. In the 1980s, he described his suits as a \"cross between the big-shouldered 'Miami Vice' look and the authentic Savile Row.\" He created the clothing of the Joker worn by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film \"Batman\". Nutter died in 1992 at the Cromwell Hospital in London of complications from AIDS.",

    "claim": "C. V. Ananda Bose (1886–1954) was an Indian freedom fighter, lawyer, and politician.",
    "evidence": "C.V. Ananda Bose is an Indian civil servant who served in the Indian Administrative Service. He is notable for not yielding to the corrupt system of the Indian bureaucracy. An eminent administrator, writer, orator, and innovator, Dr. C.V. Ananda Bose pioneered pathbreaking administrative innovations in rural development, affordable housing, eco-tourism development, redressal of public grievances, women's empowerment, development of weaker sections of society, and promotion of art and culture. The innovations have found expression in various developmental programmes that have been executed at the district, state, and national levels in India.\n\nIt was in the area of low-cost housing that Dr. Bose pioneered a movement that won international acclaim. He set up the first Nirmithi Kendra (building centre) in the country in the Kollam district, which became the institutional mechanism for the propagation of cost-effective, environment-friendly (CEEF) building technology. This was positively evaluated by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Government of India (1993). Based on the Kollam model, the Government of India launched the National Building Centre Movement to replicate Nirmithi Kendras (building centres) in every district of the country. The Nirmithi Movement was adjudged by the United Nations as one of the global best practices in the field of sustainable human settlement development.\n\nEarly in his career, Dr. Bose introduced the \"Gramotsava\" programme in Kerala, wherein the local people were encouraged to actively participate in the village development planning. The initiative, launched in the Kasargode district of Kerala in the 1980s, was subsequently implemented in 200 panchayats across the state. Dr. Bose also founded the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in the Kollam district during his tenure as Collector. The Council generated high tourism interest in the region and created new job opportunities for the local people. The Government of Kerala subsequently set up similar councils in all 14 districts of the state. DTPs have made perceptible contributions in positioning Kerala as \"God's own country\".\n\nHe later pioneered an eco-village programme in the Mannanan village of the Kottayam district of Kerala, wherein the family clusters were encouraged to pursue activities such as organic farming, soil and water conservation through traditional methods, floriculture, horticulture, vermiculture, generation of energy from non-conventional sources, homestead forestry, etc., with institutional support, governmental assistance, and financial support from different agencies.\n\nAs Chairman of the Atomic Energy Education Society, Mumbai, Dr. Bose introduced and reinforced the concept of alternative education, wherein people could pursue studies in disciplines in which they did not have prior academic backgrounds. He founded the Institute of Alternative Education. He also launched the ASTER Project (Application of Science & Technology in Educational Reforms) which sought to alter the mode of academic delivery through the application of information and communication technology (ICT).\n\nAs Managing Director of NAFED, Dr. Bose initiated a few innovative programmes which helped control the price spiral during 2009-10. Christened as \"Farm Gate to Home Gate\", this innovation sought to buy agricultural produce directly from the farmers for distribution among the consumers, taking only marginal profit. Spurred by the success of this pilot programme in New Delhi, the Easy Market Scheme was envisaged for price control in the rest of the country.\n\nAs the administrator of the National Museum, Dr. Bose launched a 100-day programme which spelt out specific measures to revamp and revitalise the institution. Most of the improvements suggested were achieved in 60 days, such as opening the closed-down galleries, modernising the display and lighting, launching outreach programmes to take the museum to the community, arranging children's programmes to ignite young minds to the greatness of India's national heritage, organising international exhibitions, and launching the People's Museum Movement, to mention a few.\n\nPursuit of excellence was always central to Dr. Bose's role in public administration. His contributions were seldom circumscribed by the call of duty. Instead, he has been engaged in continuous research and field experimentation in developing the most appropriate, people-first solutions. He also took key steps to synergise the various government programmes and schemes to create comprehensive, sustainable, and inclusive administrative mechanisms that have since been replicated in multiple domains.\n\nIn recognition of this remarkable turnaround of the museum management and the perceptible makeover of the institution, the Government of India asked Dr. Bose to continue with this mission even after his retirement from service.",

    "evidence": "Catherine Johnson (born 14 October 1957) is a British playwright, producing works for stage and television. She is best known for her script for the musical Mamma Mia! and screenplay for the film of the same name, which became the highest grossing UK film of all time and the biggest selling UK DVD of all time in January 2009. Johnson grew up in Wickwar near Wotton-under-Edge and attended Katharine Lady Berkeley's School in Wotton. She was expelled from school at 16, married at 18, and divorced by the age of 24. She moved to Bristol and, finding herself unemployed and with one child to support and another on the way, she spotted a notice in the local paper for the Bristol Old Vic/HTV West Playwriting Competition. She wrote \"Rag Doll\", using the pseudonym \"Maxwell Smart\", a play about incest and child abuse, which won the competition and was staged by the Bristol Old Vic. Further plays for the Bush Theatre in London, Bristol Old Vic, and Show of Strength followed, along with work on television series including \"Casualty\", \"Love Hurts\", and \"Byker Grove\". Johnson lives in Bristol and also owns a house in Pimlico, London. In 2007, Johnson instituted the Catherine Johnson Award for best play written by the five Pearson Playwrights' Scheme Bursary winners from the previous year. Catherine won a bursary from the scheme in 1991. She is a patron of the Wotton Electric Picture House in Wotton-under-Edge, Bristol's Myrtle Theatre Company, and \"Arts and Community\" in Thornbury.",

Afigbo took up his career as a historian in the 1950s with the celebrated Ibadan School of History, which for about three decades was the most prominent school of history in Africa. He became a prominent member of that school, which devoted its time to demonstrating the need for African history and historiography as specific genres of world history. In pursuing the mission of this school through teaching and scholarly work, Afigbo produced works that established reconstructionist history, African historical methodologies, and links between history and statecraft. He gave rein to eclecticism of sources and methods, using as the occasion demands and warrants elements from myth, oral sources, archaeology, linguistics, material artefacts and written sources. In the last analysis, he defined a historian as a clinical student of human experience who seeks to tell the story as it is and to explain it.",

Ifargan's admirers include a mix of low-income Mizrahi Jewish people from southern Israel, as well as high-profile Israeli politicians, businessmen, and celebrities. Ifargan also has a following among a group of Breslov Hasidim. Ifargan is the son of Shalom Ifargan (Baba Shalom), and he transformed his father's tomb in Netivot into an ultramodern, pyramid-shaped mausoleum, where he conducts an annual gala event and holds his midnight tikkun (reparation) ceremonies. Ifargan provides blessings and business advice to some of Israel's most prominent businessmen and politicians for a fee, and adherents believe he has the ability to diagnose patients by eyesight only. Others claim he is a charlatan who has grown into a multimillionaire from selling amulets and from other illicit businesses. He is one of the wealthiest rabbis in Israel, with an estimated net worth of $23 million as of 2012. One of the foremost followers of the rabbi is Nochi Dankner, a leading Israeli businessman, who has donated hundreds of thousands of Israeli shekels to the rabbi's causes. A 2001 report by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth claimed that most of the sums donated are not made known to the Israeli tax authorities, although this is denied by Ifargan.",

Her younger sister, Bridgette Caquatto, was also an elite gymnast on the senior US National Team. She first qualified as an elite gymnast in 2007 and competed at the 2007 US National Championships, where she finished 17th. Mackenzie competed as a senior for the first time at the 2008 US National Championships and placed 10th overall. She was selected to be a member of her first national team and qualified for the 2008 US Olympic Team Trials, but competed only on the first day of competition, placing 12th in the all-around on that day.\n\nIn 2009, Caquatto competed at her first international meets as a member of the national team. Caquatto suffered a knee injury shortly after, but managed to place 5th at the 2009 US National Championships. She was then invited to the World Championships Selection Camp and was named as the first alternate for the team. In addition to her status as an alternate, she was sent to the Toyota International in Toyota City, Japan. At this competition, she competed on the uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise, winning the silver medal on the uneven bars with a score of 14.675, only behind world silver medalist on the event, Koko Tsurumi of Japan.\n\nCaquatto started her 2010 season by competing at the City of Jesolo Trophy, where she had the highest beam score but made mistakes on the floor which kept her from medaling in the all-around. Caquatto competed at the 2010 CoverGirl Classic and placed 3rd in the all-around, scoring the second highest on vault and the uneven bars but falling from the balance beam. She had qualified to compete at the 2010 US National Championships. At the 2010 US National Championships, Mackenzie placed 5th in the all-around. She fell on a simple change grip skill on the uneven bars, her best event, placing 4th. After the US Nationals, Mackenzie was selected to attend a selection camp for the 2010 World Championships. From there, she advanced to the second camp where she won the all-around competition. She was eventually selected to compete.\n\nAt the World Championships, Mackenzie competed in the all-around in the qualifying round. After hitting all her routines without major error, she placed 9th individually and 3rd with the team. Although the top 24 qualifiers advance to the individual all-around final, she was left out because fellow American athletes Aly Raisman and Rebecca Bross had qualified ahead of her and only two athletes from each country can qualify to a final. After the qualifying round, Mackenzie was selected to compete on the uneven bars and the vault during the team finals. She contributed a 14.666 on the bars and a 15.000 on the vault to help the team win the silver medal behind Russia and ahead of China.\n\nShe competed as a Florida Gator at the NCAA level for the 2010–2011 season, where she became injured but still competed in the all-around for her team at the NCAA Championships. After finishing the NCAA season, Mackenzie decided to train for a comeback to elite gymnastics for the 2011 season. Mackenzie began her 2011 elite season by competing at the CoverGirl Classic. At the classic, she competed a slightly watered down balance beam routine and a solid uneven bars routine, scoring 14.100 and 14.750, respectively.\n\nAt the 2011 US Visa National Championships, Mackenzie surprised many by competing in the all-around. On day 1 of the competition, Mackenzie was in second place after the two rotations; after scoring a 14.700 and 15.000 on vault and uneven bars, respectively. Unfortunately, she counted her first fall on the balance beam. After having a solid floor exercise, she finished her night in sixth place with an all-around score of 56.000. On the final day of competition, Mackenzie competed solidly on all her events. Taking advantage of injuries to defending national champion Rebecca Bross and Chellsie Memmel, Mackenzie went on to finish the championships in fourth place behind Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, and champion Jordyn Wieber. She also took second place on the uneven bars just behind Wieber by 0.050.\n\nMackenzie was given a spot on her fourth national team and was invited to compete at the first World Team Selection Camp. She was considered to be a likely pick for the World Team, but injured her ankles when dismounting the beam at the selection camp and therefore lost her chance of going to Tokyo. After sitting out the beginning of the NCAA season, she competed on the uneven bars in early 2012 and is expected to reintroduce her beam routine soon.",

He is known among his followers for his supposed healing and prognostic powers. Ifargan's admirers include a mix of low-income Mizrahi Jewish people from southern Israel, as well as high-profile Israeli politicians, businessmen, and celebrities. Ifargan also has a following among a group of Breslov Hasidim. Ifargan is the son of Shalom Ifargan (Baba Shalom), and he transformed his father's tomb in Netivot into an ultramodern, pyramid-shaped mausoleum, where he conducts an annual gala event and holds his midnight tikkun (reparation) ceremonies. Ifargan provides blessings and business advice to some of Israel's most prominent businessmen and politicians for a fee, and adherents believe he has the ability to diagnose patients by eyesight only. Others claim he is a charlatan who has grown into a multimillionaire from selling amulets and from other illicit businesses. He is one of the wealthiest rabbis in Israel, with an estimated net worth of $23 million as of 2012. One of the foremost followers of the rabbi is Nochi Dankner, a leading Israeli businessman, who has donated hundreds of thousands of Israeli shekels to the rabbi's causes. A 2001 report by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth claimed that most of the sums donated are not made known to the Israeli tax authorities, although this is denied by Ifargan.",

    "evidence": "Royce Campbell is a jazz guitarist primarily associated with mainstream jazz, but he has also released smooth jazz and post-bop jazz recordings. He was born in Seymour, Indiana, in 1952. The son of a career Navy man, Campbell grew up in various cities around the U.S. and abroad, including Asia, Europe, and the West Indies. Exposure to various musical genres while a child contributed to Campbell's musical style and approach in jazz composition and playing. A love for rock and roll marked Campbell's first connection with the guitar, at the age of nine, when he discovered Chuck Berry. Like many guitarists of his generation, Campbell was also influenced by Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. By the time Royce finished high school in the early 1970s, he was certain he wanted to pursue a professional career in music. His uncle, Carroll Decamp, an arranger/pianist who arranged for Stan Kenton and Les Elgart, invited Royce to live with him and study in Indiana, providing most of Royce's musical education in theory and composition. By age 21, Campbell had begun touring with R&B artist Marvin Gaye and developing his talents for stage performance. In 1975, Royce was hired by a local music contractor to do three concerts with award-winning film composer Henry Mancini in Indianapolis. Soon after, Royce became the touring guitarist with Henry Mancini's orchestra, holding that position until Mancini's death in 1994. While appearing on recordings as a sideman, and a couple as leader, during the early years of his career, Campbell started recording and touring more on his own during the 1990s, focusing at first on mainstream or straight-ahead jazz. Although he cites Wes Montgomery as his main influence, the influence of horn players such as Dexter Gordon and Chet Baker are evident in Royce's melodic style. In 1993, he produced Project G-5: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery, which also featured guitarists Tal Farlow, Jimmy Raney, Herb Ellis, and Cal Collins. His 1994 album 6x6 featured guitarists Pat Martino, John Abercrombie, Larry Coryell, Dave Stryker, and Bucky Pizzarelli. With Project G-5: A Tribute to Joe Pass, in 1999, he combined the talents of Charlie Byrd, Gene Bertoncini, Mundell Lowe, and John Pisano. During his career, Royce Campbell has released more than 30 CDs as leader or co-leader, among various sideman projects. Fifteen of these CDs have made it onto the US National Jazz Radio Charts. Campbell's soloing is documented among other jazz guitarists of the era, in Mel Bay's Anthology of Jazz Guitar Solos: Featuring Solos by the World's Finest Jazz Guitarists! In November 2010, Royce Campbell was inducted into the Indianapolis Jazz Foundation Hall of Fame.",

    "evidence": "Richard Michael \"Kip\" Carpenter (14 August 1929 – 26 February 2012) was an English television screenwriter, author, and actor who created a number of British television series, including \"Robin of Sherwood\" and \"Catweazle\". Born in King's Lynn, Norfolk, Carpenter attended the Old Vic Theatre School before starting an acting career by working in rep. He appeared in occasional films, but was mostly active on British TV in the 1960s as a character player, on one occasion opposite Tony Hancock in one of his last shows for the BBC, commonly known as \"The Bowmans\". Other TV shows in which he appeared in the 1960s included \"Z-Cars\", \"Dixon of Dock Green\", and \"Gideon's Way\".\n\nIn 1969, Carpenter created \"Catweazle\", the children's series about an unfortunate wizard from the 11th century who is accidentally transported to the present day. This changed the course of his career substantially. Carpenter earned international recognition and a Writers Guild Award for creating the cult children's TV series.\n\nDuring the 1970s, he wrote the series \"The Ghosts of Motley Hall\" (1976–78), \"Dick Turpin\" (1979–82), parts of the series \"The Famous Five\" and \"Doctor Snuggles\", and seventeen episodes of \"The Adventures of Black Beauty\" for ITV companies; and \"Cloud Burst\", \"The Boy from Space\", and \"The King's Dragon\" as part of BBC's \"Look and Read\" (1967–2004) programme for schools, some episodes of which he also presented.\n\nIn the 1980s came the historical adventures \"Smuggler\" and its later antipodean-based follow-up \"Adventurer\", and between them, the lavish HTV production \"Robin of Sherwood\", which ran for three series. Carpenter then worked on a number of series for children and families in the 1990s (\"The Winjin' Pom\", \"Stanley's Dragon\", and \"Out of Sight\"), some of which (\"The Borrowers\", \"The Return of the Borrowers\", and \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\") were based on classic novels.\n\nCarpenter wrote novelisations of many of the early series he created: \"Catweazle\", \"Cloud Burst\", \"The Ghosts of Motley Hall\", \"Smuggler\", \"Robin of Sherwood\" (two books), and two books of \"Dick Turpin\". Carpenter died from a pulmonary embolism on 26 February 2012 at the age of 82.",

Windelband was a Neo-Kantian who protested other Neo-Kantians of his time and maintained that \"to understand Kant rightly means to go beyond him\". Against his positivist contemporaries, Windelband argued that philosophy should engage in humanistic dialogue with the natural sciences rather than uncritically appropriating its methodologies. His interests in psychology and cultural sciences represented an opposition to psychologism and historicism schools by a critical philosophic system. Windelband relied in his effort to reach beyond Kant on such philosophers as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Johann Friedrich Herbart, and Hermann Lotze. Closely associated with Windelband was Heinrich Rickert. Windelband's disciples were not only noted philosophers, but sociologists like Max Weber and theologians like Ernst Troeltsch and Albert Schweitzer.",

    "evidence": "Geoffrey Merton \"Geoff\" Griffin (12 June 1939 - 16 November 2006) was a cricketer who played two Tests for South Africa in 1960. In his second Test appearance in 1960 at Lord's, he became the first (and, as of November 2014, only) South African cricketer to take a hat-trick in a Test match, and also the first and only cricketer to take a Test hat-trick at Lord's. He is best known for being no-balled for throwing in his second Test and the exhibition match that followed, and he never played Test cricket again.\n\nGriffin was born in Greytown in the former Natal Province and was educated at Durban High School. He was tall and blond, and excelled in many sports, playing hockey for Rhodesia and under-19s rugby for Natal. He was also Natal champion in the high jump, long jump, triple jump and pole vault. Griffin suffered an accident in childhood which rendered him unable to straighten his right arm.\n\nThere was continuing controversy about bowlers \"throwing\" or \"chucking\" the ball (that is, flexing their elbow in the action of bowling the ball, which is contrary to the laws of cricket). The issue had been controversial since the editor of Wisden, Sydney Pardon, claimed that Australian fast bowler Ernest Jones was throwing in the tour of England in 1896, and then Jones and C. B. Fry were both no-balled in the Melbourne Test in 1897. The issue achieved renewed prominence following the Ashes series in Australia in 1958-59, when Australians Ian Meckiff and Gordon Rorke were suspected of throwing. Other fast bowlers, such as West Indies' Charlie Griffith and New Zealand's Gary Bartlett were also suspected. The MCC was determined to stamp out the problem before the Ashes series in England in 1961, and English umpires were instructed to strictly enforce the rule against throwing in 1960.\n\nGriffin made his first-class cricket debut for Natal in the 1957-58 South African domestic season, as a fast bowler. Despite being no-balled in South African provincial matches in the 1959-60 season, Griffin finished at the top of the averages, with 35 wickets at a bowling average of 12.23, and was selected to tour England in 1960, aged 20. Griffin was no-balled 8 times during the tour match against the MCC at Lord's in May 1960, the first time that a touring player was called for throwing, and no-balled again several times by various umpires in matches against the counties. He tried to change his action at Alf Gover's indoor school, and was not called once in the 42 overs that he bowled in the 1st Test at Edgbaston, although his pace was much reduced. In the search for quicker deliveries, he fell back into his old faults, and was called in a tour match against Hampshire. English umpires Frank Lee and Syd Buller repeatedly called Geoff Griffin for throwing in the 2nd Test, at Lord's, starting from his third over.\n\nAfter being no-balled 5 times on the first day and 6 times on the second day, he returned for a final bowling spell on Saturday 25 June and dismissed M. J. K. Smith with the last ball of one over, caught behind by John Waite for 99, and then bowled Peter Walker and Fred Trueman with the first two balls of his next over. This was the first Test cricket hat-trick claimed by a South African cricketer. England immediately declared their first innings for 362 with 8 wickets down. England quickly dismissed South Africa twice to win by an innings and 73 runs, just after lunch on the fourth day, Monday 27 June, with Brian Statham taking 6-62 and 5-34.\n\nA 20-over exhibition match was arranged to fill the period until the scheduled presentation of the players to the Queen at tea. Griffin was again repeatedly no-balled in the exhibition match for throwing, and was also no-balled for failing to notify the umpires that he was changing to bowl underarm to complete an over. Griffin later recounted that Donald Bradman came to the dressing room to console him, and let him know that the umpires were acting on order from MCC President Gubby Allen. Griffin remained on the tour as a batsman, but never played Test cricket again.\n\nMany spectators could see no difference between his \"legitimate\" deliveries, and the ones that were no-balled: many concluded that he threw every delivery. The public saw him as a martyr and scapegoat, and he was warmly applauded by the spectators at all of his subsequent tour matches. None of the controversial Australian bowlers from the 1958-59 Ashes series toured England in 1961. He moved to play for Rhodesia, but his cricket career ended less than 2 years later, at the age of 23, after he was no-balled playing in a Currie Cup match against North Eastern Transvaal at Salisbury.\n\nIn retirement from cricket, he played club cricket, was a cricket coach, and worked as a hotel manager for South African Breweries in Durban, at the Argyll, and then at the Congela Hotel. He married twice. Griffin died of a heart attack in Durban.",

Dahl occupies a central position in Norwegian artistic life of the first half of the 19th century.\"\n\nAlthough Dahl spent much of his life outside of Norway, his love for his country is clear in the motifs he chose for his paintings and in his extraordinary efforts on behalf of Norwegian culture generally. Indeed, if one sets aside his own monumental artistic creations, his other activities on behalf of art, history, and culture would still have guaranteed him a place at the very heart of the artistic and cultural history of Norway.

On 19 September 1918, he was transferred to his final wartime post, with Escadrille SPA31. He scored his final triumph solo ten days later. On 9 November 1918, he was awarded the \"Légion d'Honneur\" to accompany his prior awards of the \"Croix de Guerre\" with five \"palmes\", one \"étoile de vermeil\", one \"étoile d'argent\", and another \"étoile de bronze\".

The favourite son of his father as a child, Philip was enthroned alongside Louis VI as joint king in 1129. However, the young king gave his father little joy after that, refusing to pay attention to the old king or to follow the high standards that Louis himself followed. He became disobedient, refusing to heed scoldings or warnings; Walter Map said that he \"strayed from the paths of conduct travelled by his father and, by his overweening pride and tyrannical arrogance, made himself a burden to all.\" Philip's brief period as king was ended two years after his coronation. Riding with a group of companions along the Seine, in the Parisian market section named the Greve, his running horse was tripped by a black pig which darted out of a dung heap on the quay. The horse fell forwards, and the young king was catapulted over its head. The fall \"so dreadfully fractured his limbs that he died on the day following\" without regaining consciousness. He was buried at St Denis, and succeeded as heir, and co-king, by his pious brother, Louis the Younger (now known as Louis VII).\n\nIf Philip had been little other than trouble and a problem to his family and kingdom whilst he had lived, his legacy would prove greater trouble still. Whilst he had lived, he had nurtured a dream of visiting Jerusalem and the tomb of Christ; when he died, his brother, Louis VII, vowed to go in Philip's place. This vow would provide a reason for Louis joining the disastrous Second Crusade and an excuse to abandon Antioch in favour of Jerusalem. The Crusade brought many deaths on both sides, and the abandonment of Antioch proved a strategic failure and a partial cause for the collapse of the marriage between Louis and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Because he was co-king rather than a king in his own right, he is not generally given a number in the succession of Kings of France.",

He was born on December 14 in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania (now a part of Pittsburgh), the son of Delia Dennig Hubbard and Dewitt Clinton Clapp, an iron company executive. He graduated from the Western University of Pennsylvania (today's University of Pittsburgh) in 1877. He married Anne Love in 1882 and the couple had two children. Clapp took an engineering position at Park Brothers' Black Diamond Steel Works. There, along with Captain Alfred E. Hunt, he established the Pittsburgh Testing Laboratory's chemistry department. Hunt formed a company in 1888 to exploit the Charles Martin Hall patents for making aluminum by electrolysis. Clapp was treasurer and secretary of the fledgling company. He resigned as treasurer in 1892 and was replaced by Andrew W. Mellon. The company later became known as the Aluminium Company of America. While Hall is generally credited with the invention of the aluminum process, Clapp raised the initial venture capital to make the process commercially viable; the Mellon interests supplied the company's working capital.\n\nAs Clapp's wealth grew, he pursued his avocational interests in conchology and numismatics. He had begun collecting coins as a boy in the 1870s by sifting through the coins of a toll bridge across the Allegheny River. He later became a founder of the Western Pennsylvania Numismatic Society. His grandfather encouraged him to start collecting shells; over the years he assembled more than 100,000 mollusk shells, which he later donated to the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. In the 1930s he donated his coin collections to both the American Numismatic Society and the Carnegie.\n\nBeginning in 1907 until his death, Clapp was president of Pitt's Board of Trustees. He was a driving force in moving the school from its North Side location to the Oakland district. He also was a trustee of the Carnegie Institute of Technology (today's Carnegie Mellon University) and a member of the American Chemical Society. He died at age 90 on March 31, 1949 at his home in Sewickley, Pennsylvania. Clapp Hall, an academic building on the Pitt campus, is named in his honor.",

Grabau was born in Olvenstedt, Prussia (now a part of Greater Magdeburg, Germany). He was the son of Johann Andreas Grabau and Anna Dorothea Jericho. Grabau was educated at the grammar school in Olvenstedt (1809 - 1818), the Magdeburg Gymnasium (1818 - 1825), and at the University of Halle (1825 - 1829). After three years as a teacher in Magdeburg and Sachsa bei Nordhausen, Grabau was ordained and installed as pastor of St. Andrew's Church in Erfurt in June 1834. Grabau was jailed twice for refusing to use the Prussian Union agenda and was permitted to immigrate to America in summer 1839 with members of Lutheran congregations in Erfurt and Magdeburg. They settled in Buffalo, New York, where he served as pastor of a Lutheran congregation for 40 years. On July 15, 1845, along with four pastors, Grabau founded \"The Synod of the Lutheran Church Emigrated from Prussia\" (German: \"Synode der aus Preussen ausgewanderten lutherischen Kirche\"), which became known as \"The Buffalo Synod\". Grabau also founded the Martin Luther College in Buffalo. Grabau retained control of the Martin Luther College and remained as its rector. The official organ of Grabau's synod after 1866 was \"Die Wachende Kirche\", under his editorship. Grabau was married on July 15, 1834, to Christine Sophia Burgraf, the daughter of Johann Andreas Burggraf and Friedericke Louise Elizabeth Beulke. They had at least three children: Johann, Wilhelm, and Beata. Grabau died on June 2, 1879 in Buffalo, New York, shortly before the 40th anniversary of his arrival in the United States.",

    "evidence": "King Zhuang of Chu (died 591 BC) was a monarch of the Zhou dynasty state of Chu during the Spring and Autumn period of ancient Chinese history. His personal name was Xiong Lü, ancestral name Mi (芈), and King Zhuang was his posthumous title. He became one of the Five Hegemons and attempted to wrest control of China from the King of Zhou. King Zhuang ascended the throne in 613 BC at a time when the kingdom of Chu was in disarray. For the first three years of his reign, Zhuang wasted time on excessive hunting and lavish partying. Several courtiers were anxious about the king, but none dared speak up as he had given orders that anyone who challenged his authority would be killed. When a particularly senior minister challenged him through a riddle, the king responded that he had been waiting for three years for someone from his court to show some nationalistic pride. The king made Sunshu Ao chancellor and began a series of reforms. Chu's agricultural output improved significantly during his reign, aided by Sunshu Ao's comprehensive dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir created in modern-day northern Anhui province. In 611 BC he annexed the state of Yong (庸国), a move which made Chu much stronger. After some overwhelming victories at the head of his army, King Zhuang attempted to take the place of King Ding of Zhou. He asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the nine tripod cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China at the time, but was rebuffed. In the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the state of Jin, another strong state at that time. Later he achieved hegemony amongst some other states. His progress from lazy regent to a hegemon of his time gave rise to the Chinese four-character idiom of \"Yī Mǐng Jīng Rén\" (一冥而惊人).",

The Kenton trumpet section included Mike Vax, Jay Saunders, and Dennis Noday. Brown also contributed arrangements for Kenton, including \"Mi Burrito\" and \"Neverbird\". Brown remained with the Kenton Orchestra until November 1972. Before joining the Kenton Orchestra, Brown had served as arranger and trumpeter with the studio band of the United States Army Field Band at Fort Meade, Maryland (1968-71). His tenure with the Army Band and Kenton coincided closely with that of Jay Saunders, trumpet player, and jazz educator, who, while with the Kenton Orchestra, eventually played lead trumpet. Brown also has performed with Mundell Lowe, Leroy Vinnegar, Ray Brown (jazz double-bassist), Thad Jones, Jimmy Heath, Steve Gadd, and Billy Hart.

He took the position on June 1, 1994, succeeding Deane Beman, who retired after nearly 20 years in the post. Finchem had previously served as Vice President of Business Affairs, Deputy Commissioner, and Chief Operating Officer of the Tour. Finchem graduated from Princess Anne High School in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He attended the University of Richmond on a debate scholarship, receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1969. He graduated from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1973. After practicing law in Virginia Beach for three years, Finchem served in the White House during the administration of Jimmy Carter as Deputy Advisor to the President in the Office of Economic Affairs in 1978 and 1979. In the early 1980s, Finchem co-founded the National Marketing and Strategies Group in Washington, D.C. As Commissioner, Finchem has greatly expanded the earnings opportunities for PGA Tour players both domestically and internationally. He has presided over the last three television broadcasting deals (1997, 2001 and 2005) and has maximized the earnings potential of the Tour, and perhaps none was as bold as the most recent deal that excludes ABC and ESPN and challenges the Golf Channel to get better. In 2006, the total PGA Tour purse was $256.8 million, up from $56.4 million in 1994. That remarkable growth has a lot to do with Tiger Woods, but Finchem's supporters also give him some of the credit. Finchem received the 2001 Old Tom Morris Award from the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America, GCSAA's highest honor. He is a single-figure handicap golfer.",

    "evidence": "Geoffrey Merton \"Geoff\" Griffin (12 June 1939 - 16 November 2006) was a cricketer who played two Tests for South Africa in 1960. In his second Test appearance in 1960 at Lord's, he became the first (and, as of November 2014, only) South African cricketer to take a hat-trick in a Test match, and also the first and only cricketer to take a Test hat-trick at Lord's. He is best known for being no-balled for throwing in his second Test and the exhibition match that followed, and he never played Test cricket again.\n\nGriffin was born in Greytown in the former Natal Province and was educated at Durban High School. He was tall and blond, and excelled in many sports, playing hockey for Rhodesia and under-19s rugby for Natal. He was also Natal champion in the high jump, long jump, triple jump and pole vault. Griffin suffered an accident in childhood which rendered him unable to straighten his right arm.\n\nThere was continuing controversy about bowlers \"throwing\" or \"chucking\" the ball (that is, flexing their elbow in the action of bowling the ball, which is contrary to the laws of cricket). The issue had been controversial since the editor of Wisden, Sydney Pardon, claimed that Australian fast bowler Ernest Jones was throwing in the tour of England in 1896, and then Jones and C. B. Fry were both no-balled in the Melbourne Test in 1897. The issue achieved renewed prominence following the Ashes series in Australia in 1958-59, when Australians Ian Meckiff and Gordon Rorke were suspected of throwing. Other fast bowlers, such as West Indies' Charlie Griffith and New Zealand's Gary Bartlett were also suspected. The MCC was determined to stamp out the problem before the Ashes series in England in 1961, and English umpires were instructed to strictly enforce the rule against throwing in 1960.\n\nGriffin made his first-class cricket debut for Natal in the 1957-58 South African domestic season, as a fast bowler. Despite being no-balled in South African provincial matches in the 1959-60 season, Griffin finished at the top of the averages, with 35 wickets at a bowling average of 12.23, and was selected to tour England in 1960, aged 20. Griffin was no-balled 8 times during the tour match against the MCC at Lord's in May 1960, the first time that a touring player was called for throwing, and no-balled again several times by various umpires in matches against the counties. He tried to change his action at Alf Gover's indoor school, and was not called once in the 42 overs that he bowled in the 1st Test at Edgbaston, although his pace was much reduced. In the search for quicker deliveries, he fell back into his old faults, and was called in a tour match against Hampshire. English umpires Frank Lee and Syd Buller repeatedly called Geoff Griffin for throwing in the 2nd Test, at Lord's, starting from his third over.\n\nAfter being no-balled 5 times on the first day and 6 times on the second day, he returned for a final bowling spell on Saturday 25 June and dismissed M. J. K. Smith with the last ball of one over, caught behind by John Waite for 99, and then bowled Peter Walker and Fred Trueman with the first two balls of his next over. This was the first Test cricket hat-trick claimed by a South African cricketer. England immediately declared their first innings for 362 with 8 wickets down. England quickly dismissed South Africa twice to win by an innings and 73 runs, just after lunch on the fourth day, Monday 27 June, with Brian Statham taking 6-62 and 5-34.\n\nA 20-over exhibition match was arranged to fill the period until the scheduled presentation of the players to the Queen at tea. Griffin was again repeatedly no-balled in the exhibition match for throwing, and was also no-balled for failing to notify the umpires that he was changing to bowl underarm to complete an over. Griffin later recounted that Donald Bradman came to the dressing room to console him, and let him know that the umpires were acting on order from MCC President Gubby Allen. Griffin remained on the tour as a batsman, but never played Test cricket again.\n\nMany spectators could see no difference between his \"legitimate\" deliveries, and the ones that were no-balled: many concluded that he threw every delivery. The public saw him as a martyr and scapegoat, and he was warmly applauded by the spectators at all of his subsequent tour matches. None of the controversial Australian bowlers from the 1958-59 Ashes series toured England in 1961. He moved to play for Rhodesia, but his cricket career ended less than 2 years later, at the age of 23, after he was no-balled playing in a Currie Cup match against North Eastern Transvaal at Salisbury.\n\nIn retirement from cricket, he played club cricket, was a cricket coach, and worked as a hotel manager for South African Breweries in Durban, at the Argyll, and then at the Congela Hotel. He married twice. Griffin died of a heart attack in Durban.",

He became vice-president of that company in 1889 and remained as such until 1896 when he became general manager of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) of Canada. Hays left GTR for a short time to serve as the president of the Southern Pacific Railway Company but returned to GTR after one year. As vice-president and general manager of GTR, he is credited with keeping the company from bankruptcy. In 1909, he became the president of GTR and all its consolidated lines, subsidiary railroads, and steamship companies. He was known for his philanthropy and received the Order of the Rising Sun, Third Class, from the Emperor of Japan in 1907. Hays is credited with the formation of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP), a dream he had to create a second transcontinental railroad within the borders of Canada. He is also blamed for the insolvency of both the GTR and the GTP. He died before his dream was complete as he perished at sea in the sinking of the RMS \"Titanic\". Before the ship collided with an iceberg, Hays made a statement that was prophetic of the disaster. His body was recovered and he was buried in Montreal. He was survived by his wife and four daughters.",

    "evidence": "Terence Michael Alderman (born 12 June 1956 in Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia) is a former Australian cricketer who played primarily as a right-arm fast-medium bowler of limited pace but nagging accuracy and movement. He began his first-class career in 1974 with Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield and came to international prominence when he was chosen for the Australian national team to tour England in 1981. In that series, he took 42 test wickets, including nine on debut, the biggest haul in a series since Jim Laker's 46 in 1956 and the fourth-highest total of all time. Alderman's 42 wickets is the record for the most wickets taken in a series without taking 10 wickets in a match. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the Almanack's 1982 edition. He was disabled from playing for over a year by a shoulder injury sustained on 13 November 1982 when he rashly tackled an English-supporting ground invader at the WACA Ground in Perth. Alderman took part in an unofficial Australian tour of South Africa in 1985–86 and 1986–87, when that country was banned from test cricket as a Commonwealth anti-apartheid sanction. As a result, he received a 3-year ban from international cricket which disqualified him from playing in the 1985 Ashes series in England. Following his suspension, Alderman returned to the Australian side and resumed his success against England, taking 41 wickets in the 1989 Ashes series and another 16 in the 1990–91 series, his final Ashes appearance. He rarely enjoyed similar success against other countries. His final test series was against the West Indies in 1990–91, where he ended his career with 170 test wickets. He was a poor batsman, passing fifty just once in his career and averaging barely eight in first-class cricket. He had three seasons in English county cricket, with Kent (1984 and 1986) and then with Gloucestershire (1988). He now works as a courier for Mercury in Western Australia. On 28 July 2000, Alderman was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for being the all-time leading wicket taker for Western Australia. Alderman's sister Denise Emerson is married to former test umpire Ross Emerson and herself played seven tests for the Australian women's cricket team.

Thirds were relegated at the end of the 1964-65 season though, and Mackay was one of several players released. Mackay opted to move to Australia at this juncture, joining Melbourne Croatia of the Victorian State League. He helped the side to the state title in 1968 and several Dockerty Cup triumphs but left when Croatia were suspended following crowd disturbances in 1972.

From 16 May 2013 to 17 October 2013, Monti was the President of Civic Choice, a centrist political party.",

The son of a carpenter from Panadura, Dananjaya is another installment of Sri Lanka's long line of unorthodox spinners. Officially a left-hand batsman and an off-break bowler, he is said to have seven variations, including the leg-break, googly, carrom ball, doosra, and his stock off-spinner that had impressed national team captain Mahela Jayawardene so much in the nets as to make Jayawardene request him to be fast-tracked into the national squad. Dananjaya had at that point played no first-class, List A, T20, or even U-19 cricket. This in turn led to controversy as his selection was questioned by the media on the basis of a net performance. He was selected to play for Wayamba United in the inaugural Sri Lanka Premier League. In only his second match for the franchise, he took 3-18 against Nagenahira Nagas, consistently disturbing the batsmen with his flight, googly, and other variations. This in turn led to a place in the final squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20. In the 2013 IPL auctions, Dananjaya was sold to the Chennai Super Kings for his base price of $20,000.",

His main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A. Hobart (Rep.), was also an Eastern banker and industrialist who had served on his party's national committee. Sewall was Bryan's running mate for the first of Bryan's three times as the Democratic presidential nominee. He died not long after Bryan was nominated for the second time in 1900.

    "claim": "He was a member of the Indian delegation to the United Nations in 1951.",
    "evidence": "C.V. Ananda Bose is an Indian civil servant who served in the Indian Administrative Service. He is notable for not yielding to the corrupt system of the Indian bureaucracy. An eminent administrator, writer, orator, and innovator, Dr. C.V. Ananda Bose pioneered pathbreaking administrative innovations in rural development, affordable housing, eco-tourism development, redressal of public grievances, women's empowerment, development of weaker sections of society, and promotion of art and culture. The innovations have found expression in various developmental programmes that have been executed at the district, state, and national levels in India.\n\nIt was in the area of low-cost housing that Dr. Bose pioneered a movement that won international acclaim. He set up the first Nirmithi Kendra (building centre) in the country in the Kollam district, which became the institutional mechanism for the propagation of cost-effective, environment-friendly (CEEF) building technology. This was positively evaluated by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Government of India (1993). Based on the Kollam model, the Government of India launched the National Building Centre Movement to replicate Nirmithi Kendras (building centres) in every district of the country. The Nirmithi Movement was adjudged by the United Nations as one of the global best practices in the field of sustainable human settlement development.\n\nEarly in his career, Dr. Bose introduced the \"Gramotsava\" programme in Kerala, wherein the local people were encouraged to actively participate in the village development planning. The initiative, launched in the Kasargode district of Kerala in the 1980s, was subsequently implemented in 200 panchayats across the state. Dr. Bose also founded the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in the Kollam district during his tenure as Collector. The Council generated high tourism interest in the region and created new job opportunities for the local people. The Government of Kerala subsequently set up similar councils in all 14 districts of the state. DTPs have made perceptible contributions in positioning Kerala as \"God's own country\".\n\nHe later pioneered an eco-village programme in the Mannanan village of the Kottayam district of Kerala, wherein the family clusters were encouraged to pursue activities such as organic farming, soil and water conservation through traditional methods, floriculture, horticulture, vermiculture, generation of energy from non-conventional sources, homestead forestry, etc., with institutional support, governmental assistance, and financial support from different agencies.\n\nAs Chairman of the Atomic Energy Education Society, Mumbai, Dr. Bose introduced and reinforced the concept of alternative education, wherein people could pursue studies in disciplines in which they did not have prior academic backgrounds. He founded the Institute of Alternative Education. He also launched the ASTER Project (Application of Science & Technology in Educational Reforms) which sought to alter the mode of academic delivery through the application of information and communication technology (ICT).\n\nAs Managing Director of NAFED, Dr. Bose initiated a few innovative programmes which helped control the price spiral during 2009-10. Christened as \"Farm Gate to Home Gate\", this innovation sought to buy agricultural produce directly from the farmers for distribution among the consumers, taking only marginal profit. Spurred by the success of this pilot programme in New Delhi, the Easy Market Scheme was envisaged for price control in the rest of the country.\n\nAs the administrator of the National Museum, Dr. Bose launched a 100-day programme which spelt out specific measures to revamp and revitalise the institution. Most of the improvements suggested were achieved in 60 days, such as opening the closed-down galleries, modernising the display and lighting, launching outreach programmes to take the museum to the community, arranging children's programmes to ignite young minds to the greatness of India's national heritage, organising international exhibitions, and launching the People's Museum Movement, to mention a few.\n\nPursuit of excellence was always central to Dr. Bose's role in public administration. His contributions were seldom circumscribed by the call of duty. Instead, he has been engaged in continuous research and field experimentation in developing the most appropriate, people-first solutions. He also took key steps to synergise the various government programmes and schemes to create comprehensive, sustainable, and inclusive administrative mechanisms that have since been replicated in multiple domains.\n\nIn recognition of this remarkable turnaround of the museum management and the perceptible makeover of the institution, the Government of India asked Dr. Bose to continue with this mission even after his retirement from service.",

He retired from the 500 cc race with a blown engine, again riding his 350, when holding third place. He won the 1935 Junior Manx Grand Prix and then joined the Norton team for the 1936 TT races. It was a winning combination as he claimed the Junior TT and finished second in the Senior TT as well as winning the 350 cc European Championship. In 1937 he went one better in the Senior and took a brilliant win and setting the first 90 mph plus lap of the Snaefell Mountain Course. After finishing third in the 1939 Senior he missed the 1947 TT due to a practice spill on a 500 cc Moto Guzzi. Turning to Velocettes in 1948, he won the Junior race, repeating this success a year later. Freddie also has the distinction of being the first ever 350 cc World Champion in 1949 when he won all five events of the inaugural campaign. Frith, alongside other riders from BSA, Ariel and Matchless works teams, served in the army during World War II at the Infantry Driving & Maintenance School stationed at Keswick, where officers and NCOs learned how to ride cross-country.

Mystica was released later that year, again through Peaceville Records. The album had less of a goth sound and more of a classic rock-influenced progressive sound.

The band were looking to develop their sound and keyboard player Benjamin Ryan was told to leave the band in April 1998. However, this dismayed Paul Ryan, and shortly afterwards the band split up.

In 1820, he took part in a scientific expedition to Bokhara as a naturalist. In 1826, he became a member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Pander studied the chick embryo and discovered the germ layers (i.e., three distinct regions of the embryo that give rise to the specific organ system). Because of these findings, he is considered by many to be the \"founder of embryology\". His work in embryology was continued by Karl Ernst von Baer (1792–1876), who expanded Pander's concept of germ layers to include all vertebrates. Pander performed important studies in the field of paleontology, being known for his extensive research on fossils found in the Devonian and Silurian geological strata of the Baltic regions. His study of trilobites from this age led to the adjective \"Panderian\", first used by the Canadian palaeontologist Elkanah Billings. Pander is credited as the first scientist to describe primitive creatures known as conodonts. Today, the Pander Society is an international association of palaeontologists and stratigraphers with a common interest in the study of conodonts. He died in Saint Petersburg.",

    "evidence": "Terence Michael Alderman (born 12 June 1956 in Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia) is a former Australian cricketer who played primarily as a right-arm fast-medium bowler of limited pace but nagging accuracy and movement. He began his first-class career in 1974 with Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield and came to international prominence when he was chosen for the Australian national team to tour England in 1981. In that series, he took 42 test wickets, including nine on debut, the biggest haul in a series since Jim Laker's 46 in 1956 and the fourth-highest total of all time. Alderman's 42 wickets is the record for the most wickets taken in a series without taking 10 wickets in a match. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the Almanack's 1982 edition. He was disabled from playing for over a year by a shoulder injury sustained on 13 November 1982 when he rashly tackled an English-supporting ground invader at the WACA Ground in Perth. Alderman took part in an unofficial Australian tour of South Africa in 1985–86 and 1986–87, when that country was banned from test cricket as a Commonwealth anti-apartheid sanction. As a result, he received a 3-year ban from international cricket which disqualified him from playing in the 1985 Ashes series in England. Following his suspension, Alderman returned to the Australian side and resumed his success against England, taking 41 wickets in the 1989 Ashes series and another 16 in the 1990–91 series, his final Ashes appearance. He rarely enjoyed similar success against other countries. His final test series was against the West Indies in 1990–91, where he ended his career with 170 test wickets. He was a poor batsman, passing fifty just once in his career and averaging barely eight in first-class cricket. He had three seasons in English county cricket, with Kent (1984 and 1986) and then with Gloucestershire (1988). He now works as a courier for Mercury in Western Australia. On 28 July 2000, Alderman was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for being the all-time leading wicket taker for Western Australia. Alderman's sister Denise Emerson is married to former test umpire Ross Emerson and herself played seven tests for the Australian women's cricket team. Alderman is an alumnus of Aquinas College, Perth.",

    "evidence": "William Luther Pierce III (September 11, 1933 – July 23, 2002) was a prominent American white nationalist and political activist. He was one of the most influential ideologues of the white nationalist movement for some 30 years before his death. A physicist by profession, he was also an author under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald of the novels The Turner Diaries and Hunter. Pierce founded the National Alliance, a major white nationalist organization, which he led for almost thirty years.\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, to a Presbyterian family of Scots-Irish and English descent, Pierce was descended from the aristocracy of the Old South, being a descendant of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. As a child, Pierce did well academically, graduating from high school in 1952. He received a baccalaureate in physics from Rice University in 1955, earned a doctorate from University of Colorado at Boulder in 1962, and became an assistant professor of physics at the Oregon State University in 1962, where he joined the anti-communist John Birch Society.\n\nIn 1965, in order to finance his political ambitions, he left his tenure at Oregon State University and became a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1966 Pierce moved to the Washington, D.C. area and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, who was assassinated in 1967, after which Pierce became co-leader of the National Youth Alliance, which split in 1974, with Pierce founding the National Alliance. Pierce intended the National Alliance to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist revolution in the United States.\n\nIn 1978, Pierce wrote, under the pseudonym \"Andrew Macdonald\", the novel The Turner Diaries, which depicts a violent revolution in the United States which leads to the overthrow of the United States federal government. In 1984, he wrote another novel, Hunter, which portrays the actions of a Vietnam veteran F-4 Phantom II pilot and Washington, D.C.-area defense department consultant who embarks on a plan to assassinate interracial couples and liberal journalists, politicians and bureaucrats in the D.C. area.\n\nIn 1985, Pierce relocated the headquarters of the National Alliance to Hillsboro, West Virginia, where he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church to receive tax exemption for his organization. Pierce spent the rest of his life in West Virginia hosting a weekly radio show, \"American Dissident Voices\", publishing the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and overseeing his publications, National Vanguard Magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. and music produced by his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce suddenly died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members and a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline. His works, however, continue to enjoy a notable audience.",

She was asked to be part of the band by Allison Robertson, and agreed even though she did not have any experience. The band rehearsed every day in her garage. Before the release of The Donnas' album \"Gold Medal\", Castellano developed tendonitis. In October 2003, she had surgery for it. During her recovery, she had to take drum lessons to re-learn to hold drumsticks the correct way. For \"Gold Medal\", she recorded with her recovering wrists, but could only play for short periods of time. A shoulder problem forced Castellano to withdraw from The Donnas' tour following a show on December 27, 2008, at the House of Blues in Anaheim, CA. Amy Cesari of the band The Demonics filled in on future tour dates. On July 9, 2010, Castellano announced on the band's website that due to her shoulder she would have to retire from drumming and performing with The Donnas. Castellano still attended events the band was involved with as well as promoted the last album she recorded with the band, \"Greatest Hits Volume 16\".

Loder (7 April 1946 – 12 August 2005) was an English sound engineer, record producer, and founder of Southern Studios, as well as a former member of Exit and co-founder of the Southern Records distribution company with his wife Sue. He was also the studio engineer of choice for Crass Records and was often considered to be the band's \"ninth member\". Loder was born near Plymouth and educated at boarding school before studying electrical engineering at London's City University. During his post-graduate work there, he became involved in early experiments in digital encoding of audio for the military. By 1970, he had joined Exit, alongside Penny Rimbaud, utilizing a one-track tape-recorder. This led to Loder eventually founding a record studio in his garage after the disbanding of Exit in 1974.\n\nLoder was recording advertising jingles in 1977 when his path crossed once again with Rimbaud, who had by then co-founded Crass, and at this point invited Loder to become the band's engineer and financial manager, roles Loder happily accepted. When Crass founded their own record label, Loder worked as an engineer on most of the label's releases, and when Loder saw potential in a number of bands turned away by Crass Records due to ideological differences, he set up Southern Records. Loder engineered and produced for many bands other than Crass, among them The Jesus and Mary Chain, for whom he engineered the recordings of the \"Psychocandy\" album, Big Black's \"Songs About Fucking\", PJ Harvey, Babes in Toyland, Fugazi, Ministry, and Shellac.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Loder established a television production facility at Southern. Its notable output included the music show \"Snub TV\", which after first being syndicated nationwide in the USA, went on to further success on BBC2 and in other countries. Loder was responsible for encouraging and establishing independent alternative internet ezines, donating the use of Southern's servers and bandwidth, taking part in pioneering online media streaming and simulcasting. Loder died of a brain tumour in 2005, aged 59.",

    "evidence": "Hephaestion (c. 356 BC – 324 BC), son of Amyntor, was a Macedonian nobleman and a general in the army of Alexander the Great. He was \"...by far the dearest of all the king's friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets.\" This friendship lasted throughout their lives, and was compared, by others as well as themselves, to that of Achilles and Patroclus. His military career was distinguished. A member of Alexander the Great's personal bodyguard, he went on to command the Companion Cavalry and was entrusted with many other tasks throughout Alexander's ten-year campaign in Asia, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges, and the foundation of new settlements. Besides being a soldier, engineer, and diplomat, he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate the Greeks and Persians. Alexander formally made him his second-in-command when he appointed him Chiliarch of the Empire. Alexander also made him part of the royal family when he gave him as his bride Drypetis, sister to his own second wife Stateira, both daughters of Darius III of Persia. When he died suddenly at Ecbatana around age thirty-two, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief. He petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant Hephaestion divine status, and thus Hephaestion was honored as a \"divine hero\". Hephaestion was cremated in Babylon in the presence of the entire army. At the time of his own death a mere eight months later, Alexander was still planning lasting monuments to Hephaestion's memory.",

Born in 1918 in Istanbul, Gündüz Kılıç attended Galatasaray Lycee and then started his football career as a center forward with Galatasaray SK. He was strong, big, well-educated, sophisticated, charismatic, charming, and hungry for success. He never looked flashy, yet was never boring. Kılıç was the mastermind behind the rise of Turkish football, schooling football players that would become respectable managers after their career. He took a break from his career in 1938, moving to Germany for a university education. When he returned to Turkey, he again wore the Galatasaray shirt and won two league championships with the team. Kılıç, who played 11 matches with the Turkey national football team, played for Galatasaray until 1953, except for when he played for Ankara Demirspor during his national service military obligation. His five goals against Beşiktaş JK are still a record for all three Istanbulian derbies. His five goals were scored in the 43rd (1-1), 58th (4-1), 73rd (5-2), 76th (6-2), and 89th (9-2).\n\nThe \"Gündüz Kılıç Revolution\" started early one morning at Galatasaray in 1952, when he hung his uniform in his locker and put on his coaching suit and whistle without looking back. Once the captain of the Galatasaray team, Gündüz Kılıç coached his former teammates and the bright young talents he added to the squad. He led his team to several championships after eighteen years without a championship between 1934 and 1952. He also transferred Turkish superstar Metin Oktay to the team. Under Kılıç, Galatasaray reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup, with the AC Milan side of Nereo Rocco ending their run. Every Galatasaray player, student, or supporter had found an exemplary man in Gündüz Kılıç: a man who performed so well, motivated so well, educated so well, and brought out the very best in every single person he ever worked with. A true gentleman both on and off the field, Gündüz Kılıç helped Galatasaray to reach new targets. Under his leadership, Galatasaray won numerous championships, Turkish Cup titles, and international matches. His visionary coaching style and strong communication skills were to be the backbone of Turkish coaching for many years to come.\n\nThe player, whose nickname was \"Father\", died in New York City, USA on 17 May 1980. His body was transferred to Istanbul and was interred at the Aşiyan Asri Cemetery.",

Under the orders of Frederick I, he had to set him free, but he was able to obtain the title. Nevertheless, the conflict with his brother continued as he tried to regain the Margraviate. After Albert died in 1195 with no children to succeed him, Meissen, with its rich mines, was seized by the Emperor Henry VI as a vacant fief of the Empire.

A physicist by profession, he was also an author under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald of the novels The Turner Diaries and Hunter. Pierce founded the National Alliance, a major white nationalist organization, which he led for almost thirty years.\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, to a Presbyterian family of Scots-Irish and English descent, Pierce was descended from the aristocracy of the Old South, being a descendant of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. As a child, Pierce did well academically, graduating from high school in 1952. He received a baccalaureate in physics from Rice University in 1955, earned a doctorate from University of Colorado at Boulder in 1962, and became an assistant professor of physics at the Oregon State University in 1962, where he joined the anti-communist John Birch Society.\n\nIn 1965, in order to finance his political ambitions, he left his tenure at Oregon State University and became a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1966 Pierce moved to the Washington, D.C. area and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, who was assassinated in 1967, after which Pierce became co-leader of the National Youth Alliance, which split in 1974, with Pierce founding the National Alliance. Pierce intended the National Alliance to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist revolution in the United States.\n\nIn 1978, Pierce wrote, under the pseudonym \"Andrew Macdonald\", the novel The Turner Diaries, which depicts a violent revolution in the United States which leads to the overthrow of the United States federal government. In 1984, he wrote another novel, Hunter, which portrays the actions of a Vietnam veteran F-4 Phantom II pilot and Washington, D.C.-area defense department consultant who embarks on a plan to assassinate interracial couples and liberal journalists, politicians and bureaucrats in the D.C. area.\n\nIn 1985, Pierce relocated the headquarters of the National Alliance to Hillsboro, West Virginia, where he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church to receive tax exemption for his organization. Pierce spent the rest of his life in West Virginia hosting a weekly radio show, \"American Dissident Voices\", publishing the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and overseeing his publications, National Vanguard Magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. and music produced by his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce suddenly died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members and a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.

Dane recommended Meagher, but cautioned, \"He's kind of weird.

In addition to providing backing vocals, Meagher sang lead on occasion, as on \"They'll Make You Cry,\" a song from the band's 1965 debut album, Introducing the Beau Brummels. Meagher appeared with the band in the 1965 science-fiction/comedy movie Village of the Giants, which was featured in a 1994 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.

After he was discharged two years later, Meagher played in the Black Velvet Band with former Beau Brummels bandmate Declan Mulligan. Over the next three decades, Meagher has also participated in several Beau Brummels revivals, most notably in the mid-1970s when the band released a 1975 self-titled reunion album.",

Born in Barmouth, Merioneth to Christopher Nutter and Dorothy (formerly Banister), he was raised in Edgware, Middlesex, where his father owned a local high street café. After the family moved to Kilburn, Nutter and his brother David attended Willesden Technical College. Nutter initially studied plumbing and then architecture, but he abandoned both aged 19 to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy. In the early 1960s, he joined traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward. After seven years, in 1969, he joined up with Edward Sexton to open \"Nutters of Savile Row\" at No. 35a Savile Row. They were financially backed by Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, managing director of the Beatles' Apple Corps Peter Brown, and lawyer James Vallance-White. The business was an immediate success, as Nutter combined traditional tailoring skills with innovative design. He designed for the Hardy Amies range, and then for the man himself. His clients included his investors, plus Sir Roy Strong, Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger and Elton John. Nutter himself was most proud of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles' album \"Abbey Road\" in 1969, he dressed three out of the four: George Harrison elected to be photographed on the road-crossing in denims.\n\nIn the 1970s, his bespoke business became less successful, but he branched out into ready-to-wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing the Savile Row brand in Japan. In 1976, Sexton bought Nutter out of the business. Nutter went to work for Kilgour French and Stanbury, managing his own workroom. Sexton continued to run Nutters of Savile Row until 1983, when Nutter returned to the Row with a ready-to-wear shop: \"Tommy Nutter, Savile Row\". (This new venture, which traded at No. 19 Savile Row until Tommy's death, was backed by J&J Crombie Limited, who continue to own the \"Tommy Nutter\" trademark.) At this time, Sexton set up a business in his own name. In the 1980s, he described his suits as a \"cross between the big-shouldered 'Miami Vice' look and the authentic Savile Row.\" He created the clothing of the Joker worn by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film \"Batman\". Nutter died in 1992 at the Cromwell Hospital in London of complications from AIDS.",

He founded Mason Science College in 1875, which later became the University of Birmingham. He was the son of a carpet-weaver and was born in Mill Street, Kidderminster. He began life as a street hawker of cakes, fruits, and vegetables. After trying his hand in his native town at shoemaking, baking, carpentry, blacksmithing, house-painting, and carpet-weaving, he moved in 1816 to Birmingham. There he found employment in the gilt-toy trade. In 1824, he set up on his own account as a manufacturer of split-rings by machinery, to which he subsequently added the making of steel pens. Owing to the circumstance of his pens being supplied through James Perry, the London stationer whose name they bore, he was less well known than Joseph Gillott and other makers, although he was really the largest producer in England, contributing heavily to the Birmingham pen trade. In 1874, the business was converted into a limited liability company. Besides his steel-pen trade, Mason carried on for many years the business of electro-plating, copper-smelting, and India-rubber ring making, in conjunction with George Elkington. Mason was almost entirely self-educated, having taught himself to write when a shoemaker's apprentice, and in later life he felt his deficiencies keenly. It was this which led him in 1860 to establish his great orphanage at Erdington, near Birmingham. Upon it he expended about £300,000, and for this munificent endowment he was knighted in 1872. He had previously given a dispensary to his native town and an almshouse to Erdington. In 1880, Mason College, since incorporated in the University of Birmingham, was opened. The total value of the endowment was about £250,000.",

    "evidence": "Ronald William George \"Ronnie\" Barker (25 September 1929 – 3 October 2005) was an English actor, comedian, and writer. He was known for roles in British comedy television series such as \"Porridge\", \"The Two Ronnies\", and \"Open All Hours\". Barker began acting in repertory theatre and decided he was best suited to comic roles. He had his first success at the Oxford Playhouse and in roles in the West End, including Tom Stoppard's \"The Real Inspector Hound\". During this period, he was in the cast of BBC radio and television comedies such as \"The Navy Lark\". He got his television break with the satirical sketch series \"The Frost Report\" in 1966, where he met future collaborator Ronnie Corbett. He joined David Frost's production company and starred in ITV shows, including a short film. After rejoining the BBC, Barker found fame with the sketch show \"The Two Ronnies\" (1971–1987), with Ronnie Corbett. He starred in the sitcoms \"Porridge\", its sequel \"Going Straight\", and \"Open All Hours\". He wrote comedy under his own name and the pseudonym Gerald Wiley, which Barker adopted to avoid pre-judgements of his talent. He won a BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance four times, among other awards, and received an OBE in 1978. Later television sitcoms such as \"The Magnificent Evans\" and \"Clarence\" were less successful and he retired in 1987. He opened an antiques shop with his wife, Joy. After 1999, he appeared in smaller, non-comic roles in films. He died of heart failure on 3 October 2005, aged 76.",

This epic effort brought to light the main contents of the book, a wealth of botanical information on Malabar that had largely remained inaccessible to English-speaking scholars, because the entire text was in the Latin language. Despite the existence of Hendrik van Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus over the last three centuries, the correct taxonomic identity of many plants listed in Hortus Malabaricus, their medicinal properties, methods of use, etc., as described and codified by renowned traditional medical authorities of 17th century India remained inaccessible to English language-based scholars, until Manilal commenced publication of research papers and books on Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal's efforts ultimately resulted in an English edition of Hortus Malabaricus, for the first time, 325 years after its original publication from Amsterdam. The English edition contains a word-by-word translation of all the twelve volumes of the book, retaining the original style of language. Medicinal properties of plants are translated and interpreted, with commentaries on their Malayalam names given by van Rheede. In addition, the correct scientific identity of all plants, acceptable under ICBN, are set out along with their important synonyms and basionyms. Whilst the scope of Manilal's contributions to botany extend far beyond the research and publications around Hortus Malabaricus, his research work on Hortus Malabaricus alone are of botanical and socio-historic significance, and can be broadly classified under two heads: botanical and medicinal aspects of Hortus Malabaricus; and historical, political, social, and linguistic aspects of Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal has over 198 published research papers and 15 books to his credit as author and co-author. He and his associates have credits to discovering over 14 species of flowering plants, varieties, and combinations new to science. Manilal is the founder president of the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT).",

Born in Yonkers, New York, Ridzik was signed by the Phillies at the age of 16 and made his Major League debut on September 4, 1950, pitching in relief. In 1951, Ridzik started 12 games and relieved in 30 more, going 9-6 with an earned run average of 3.77. The Phillies traded him on April 30, 1952, along with Smoky Burgess and Stan Palys, to the Cincinnati Redlegs for Andy Seminick, Glen Gorbous, and Jim Greengrass. After having his contract sold to Seattle of the Pacific Coast League that same year, the New York Giants claimed him the next month in the Rule 5 Draft. Ridzik pitched for the Giants from 1952 to 1957, appearing in 56 games including 5 starts. On April 8, 1958, the Giants sold his contract to the Cleveland Indians, where he would pitch in six more games before his contract was sold again to the Chicago Cubs. He would not pitch a Major League game with the Cubs before his contract was sold to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. Ridzik signed with the Washington Senators three years later in 1961 after developing a knuckleball. He would appear in 132 games, mostly in relief, over the next three years for the Senators. On April 13, 1964, his contract was sold back to his original team, the Phillies. He would appear in two games with the Phillies that year before calling it a career. After life as a baseball player, Ridzik worked in the Washington D.C. area for a military food distributor until moving to Florida in the late 1980s. In Florida, he helped with the organizing of charity events featuring former Major League players. He also helped establish the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association with former Senators teammate, Chuck Hinton.

    "evidence": "Geoffrey Merton \"Geoff\" Griffin (12 June 1939 - 16 November 2006) was a cricketer who played two Tests for South Africa in 1960. In his second Test appearance in 1960 at Lord's, he became the first (and, as of November 2014, only) South African cricketer to take a hat-trick in a Test match, and also the first and only cricketer to take a Test hat-trick at Lord's. He is best known for being no-balled for throwing in his second Test and the exhibition match that followed, and he never played Test cricket again.\n\nGriffin was born in Greytown in the former Natal Province and was educated at Durban High School. He was tall and blond, and excelled in many sports, playing hockey for Rhodesia and under-19s rugby for Natal. He was also Natal champion in the high jump, long jump, triple jump and pole vault. Griffin suffered an accident in childhood which rendered him unable to straighten his right arm.\n\nThere was continuing controversy about bowlers \"throwing\" or \"chucking\" the ball (that is, flexing their elbow in the action of bowling the ball, which is contrary to the laws of cricket). The issue had been controversial since the editor of Wisden, Sydney Pardon, claimed that Australian fast bowler Ernest Jones was throwing in the tour of England in 1896, and then Jones and C. B. Fry were both no-balled in the Melbourne Test in 1897. The issue achieved renewed prominence following the Ashes series in Australia in 1958-59, when Australians Ian Meckiff and Gordon Rorke were suspected of throwing. Other fast bowlers, such as West Indies' Charlie Griffith and New Zealand's Gary Bartlett were also suspected. The MCC was determined to stamp out the problem before the Ashes series in England in 1961, and English umpires were instructed to strictly enforce the rule against throwing in 1960.\n\nGriffin made his first-class cricket debut for Natal in the 1957-58 South African domestic season, as a fast bowler. Despite being no-balled in South African provincial matches in the 1959-60 season, Griffin finished at the top of the averages, with 35 wickets at a bowling average of 12.23, and was selected to tour England in 1960, aged 20. Griffin was no-balled 8 times during the tour match against the MCC at Lord's in May 1960, the first time that a touring player was called for throwing, and no-balled again several times by various umpires in matches against the counties. He tried to change his action at Alf Gover's indoor school, and was not called once in the 42 overs that he bowled in the 1st Test at Edgbaston, although his pace was much reduced. In the search for quicker deliveries, he fell back into his old faults, and was called in a tour match against Hampshire. English umpires Frank Lee and Syd Buller repeatedly called Geoff Griffin for throwing in the 2nd Test, at Lord's, starting from his third over.\n\nAfter being no-balled 5 times on the first day and 6 times on the second day, he returned for a final bowling spell on Saturday 25 June and dismissed M. J. K. Smith with the last ball of one over, caught behind by John Waite for 99, and then bowled Peter Walker and Fred Trueman with the first two balls of his next over. This was the first Test cricket hat-trick claimed by a South African cricketer. England immediately declared their first innings for 362 with 8 wickets down. England quickly dismissed South Africa twice to win by an innings and 73 runs, just after lunch on the fourth day, Monday 27 June, with Brian Statham taking 6-62 and 5-34.\n\nA 20-over exhibition match was arranged to fill the period until the scheduled presentation of the players to the Queen at tea. Griffin was again repeatedly no-balled in the exhibition match for throwing, and was also no-balled for failing to notify the umpires that he was changing to bowl underarm to complete an over. Griffin later recounted that Donald Bradman came to the dressing room to console him, and let him know that the umpires were acting on order from MCC President Gubby Allen. Griffin remained on the tour as a batsman, but never played Test cricket again.\n\nMany spectators could see no difference between his \"legitimate\" deliveries, and the ones that were no-balled: many concluded that he threw every delivery. The public saw him as a martyr and scapegoat, and he was warmly applauded by the spectators at all of his subsequent tour matches. None of the controversial Australian bowlers from the 1958-59 Ashes series toured England in 1961. He moved to play for Rhodesia, but his cricket career ended less than 2 years later, at the age of 23, after he was no-balled playing in a Currie Cup match against North Eastern Transvaal at Salisbury.\n\nIn retirement from cricket, he played club cricket, was a cricket coach, and worked as a hotel manager for South African Breweries in Durban, at the Argyll, and then at the Congela Hotel. He married twice. Griffin died of a heart attack in Durban.",

    "evidence": "Carlos Arniches (11 October 1866 - 16 April 1943) was a Spanish playwright, born in Alicante. His prolific work, drawing on the traditions of the género chico, the zarzuela and the grotesque, came to dominate Spanish comic theatre in the early twentieth century. After starting his career as a novelist and journalist, Arniches turned to theatre in 1888 with the publication of his first play, \"Casa Editorial\". Much of his work is set in lower-class Madrid and uses colloquial language, song, dance and music. Arniches was complimented in a 1935 interview by Federico García Lorca, often a scathing critic of Spanish theatre in the 1920s and 1930s, as \"more of a poet than almost any of those who are writing theatre in verse at the moment\". Following the consolidation of the Franco regime after the Spanish Civil War, the social dramas of Carlos Arniches were among the relatively non-controversial plays allowed by the new government.",

Sewall never held elective office, although he was a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1888 to 1896. Sewall's main claim to fame had been as an exceptionally successful, wealthy shipbuilder and New England industrialist. He was a director of the Maine Central Railroad and president of the Bath National Bank for years. His selection is believed to have been an effort to win votes among conservative and New England members of the party who were disturbed by the populist aspects of William Jennings Bryan. Sewall is also one of the few politicians to be an adherent of Swedenborgianism, a religion based on the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg. His main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A. Hobart (Rep.), was also an Eastern banker and industrialist who had served on his party's national committee. Sewall was Bryan's running mate for the first of Bryan's three times as the Democratic presidential nominee. He died not long after Bryan was nominated for the second time in 1900.

    "evidence": "Twila Shively (March 20, 1920 – November 25, 1999) was an American competitive baseball player. An outfielder, she played from 1945 through 1950 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5'2\", 128 lb., she batted and threw right-handed. Shively spent five of her six years in the AAGPBL playing in the left field. A solid defensive player, she showed speed, good hands, an accurate throwing arm, and lived in a constant state of readiness. Routinely, she ranked among the top defensive outfielders in several categories, until a severe ankle injury limited her ability to perform, and she had to switch to first base. Offensively, she made consistent contact, knew when to take the extra base, and excelled as a basestealer.\n\nBorn in Decatur, Illinois, Twila Shively was the daughter of Glenn and Eva (née Bryant) Shively. She began playing softball at age eight and moved up in the softball ranks in Chicago as early as 1942. By then, she was featured in an article signed by Carl Guldager and published in the Chicago Daily News with the headline: \"She's Hedy Lamarr of Softball, Twila Shively Looks Like Model, Runs Bases Like Ty Cobb. Has Baseball Savvy Plus Pretty Face\". In 1944, Shively became a member of the Rockola Chicks team of the newly formed National Girls Baseball League. The NGBL was organized in Chicago to keep the best local players from migrating to the AAGPBL, which had been stabilized in 1943. After that, both circuits competed against each other to see who could associate itself with the biggest stars.\n\nShively entered the AAGPBL in 1945 with the Grand Rapids Chicks, playing for them three years before joining the Chicago Colleens (1948) and Peoria Redwings (1948–1950). In her rookie year, she formed part of a Chicks outfield that included Thelma Eisen in the center field and Elizabeth Wicken at right field. Shively collected a .196 batting average and a .276 on-base percentage in 106 games, driving in 23 runs and scoring 42 times, while her 46 stolen bases ranked her fifth in the league. She also led all outfielders with a .968 fielding percentage and finished second for the most putouts (234) behind Fort Wayne Daisies' Penny O'Brian (236). During the regular season, she achieved a career highlight, when she belted a two-out, walk-off grand slam to give her team the victory.\n\nHer most productive season came in 1946, when she posted career numbers in average (.247), runs scored (78), hits (101), runs batted in (45), steals (45), and games played (111). Considering the year was great for many pitchers, her numbers were quite respectable. Four no-hitters were recorded by Anna Mae Hutchison (Belles), Betty Luna (Blue Sox), Carolyn Morris (Peaches), and Amy Irene Applegren (Lassies), while Connie Wisniewski (Chicks) and Dorothy Wiltse (Daisies) topped the league in earned run average with 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. As a result, more than half of the circuit's players averaged under .200. Dorothy Kamenshek (Peaches) was the only hitter to reach the .300 mark (.316).\n\nFollowing her baseball career, Shively graduated from Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and worked as a physical education teacher at Washington High School in South Bend, Indiana. She also coached the school's softball and volleyball teams to city championships, inspiring children for almost 30 years. Twila Shively died in Douglas, Michigan on Thanksgiving Day, 1999 at the age of 79, after suffering four years of Alzheimer's disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer. She is part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, unveiled in 1988, which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual personality.",

Following World War I, he made 65 further appearances in the Minor Counties Championship for Northumberland, with his final appearance coming against Durham in 1928. He died in the city of his birth on 3 November 1968.",

    "evidence": "Robert Holgate (1481/1482–1555) was Bishop of Llandaff and then Archbishop of York (from 1545 to 1554). He recognised Henry VIII as head of the Church of England. Although a protégé of Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, Holgate had a career in the Gilbertine Order of which he became Master. Most of the Gilbertine houses were lesser establishments which should have been dissolved under the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535 (only four out of twenty-six houses had revenues over £200 a year). However, Holgate is credited with using his influence to save them for a few years. For example, Malton Priory, one of the lesser Gilbertine houses, was the last of them to surrender in December 1539, whereas Sempringham Priory, worth more than £200 a year, surrendered in 1538.\n\nIn 1550 Holgate married Barbara Wentworth, who was about 25 at the time. This may, however, have been a second marriage to make it fully legal, and Holgate and Wentworth may have first married in late 1547 with Roger Tongue officiating. In 1551 Arthur Norman claimed that he was already married to Barbara Wentworth, but the courts decided that their marriage when she was about seven had not been a binding legal transaction. Robert and Barbara remained married until 1553, when shortly after Mary I of England came to the throne she imprisoned Holgate on various charges, with his being a married clergy being central to these. In 1554 Holgate renounced his marriage claiming he had only entered it to avoid suspicion as a papist.\n\nIn January 1555 Holgate was released from prison, but he was not restored to priestly office. He died later that year. In 1558 a Robert Holgate from Yorkshire entered the University of Cambridge. He may have been a son of Holgate, since there are some claims he had two children by Barbara, but there is no conclusive evidence on the matter.",

After practicing law in Virginia Beach for three years, Finchem served in the White House during the administration of Jimmy Carter as Deputy Advisor to the President in the Office of Economic Affairs in 1978 and 1979. In the early 1980s, Finchem co-founded the National Marketing and Strategies Group in Washington, D.C.

    "evidence": "Twila Shively (March 20, 1920 – November 25, 1999) was an American competitive baseball player. An outfielder, she played from 1945 through 1950 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5'2\", 128 lb., she batted and threw right-handed. Shively spent five of her six years in the AAGPBL playing in the left field. A solid defensive player, she showed speed, good hands, an accurate throwing arm, and lived in a constant state of readiness. Routinely, she ranked among the top defensive outfielders in several categories, until a severe ankle injury limited her ability to perform, and she had to switch to first base. Offensively, she made consistent contact, knew when to take the extra base, and excelled as a basestealer.\n\nBorn in Decatur, Illinois, Twila Shively was the daughter of Glenn and Eva (née Bryant) Shively. She began playing softball at age eight and moved up in the softball ranks in Chicago as early as 1942. By then, she was featured in an article signed by Carl Guldager and published in the Chicago Daily News with the headline: \"She's Hedy Lamarr of Softball, Twila Shively Looks Like Model, Runs Bases Like Ty Cobb. Has Baseball Savvy Plus Pretty Face\". In 1944, Shively became a member of the Rockola Chicks team of the newly formed National Girls Baseball League. The NGBL was organized in Chicago to keep the best local players from migrating to the AAGPBL, which had been stabilized in 1943. After that, both circuits competed against each other to see who could associate itself with the biggest stars.\n\nShively entered the AAGPBL in 1945 with the Grand Rapids Chicks, playing for them three years before joining the Chicago Colleens (1948) and Peoria Redwings (1948–1950). In her rookie year, she formed part of a Chicks outfield that included Thelma Eisen in the center field and Elizabeth Wicken at right field. Shively collected a .196 batting average and a .276 on-base percentage in 106 games, driving in 23 runs and scoring 42 times, while her 46 stolen bases ranked her fifth in the league. She also led all outfielders with a .968 fielding percentage and finished second for the most putouts (234) behind Fort Wayne Daisies' Penny O'Brian (236). During the regular season, she achieved a career highlight, when she belted a two-out, walk-off grand slam to give her team the victory.\n\nHer most productive season came in 1946, when she posted career numbers in average (.247), runs scored (78), hits (101), runs batted in (45), steals (45), and games played (111). Considering the year was great for many pitchers, her numbers were quite respectable. Four no-hitters were recorded by Anna Mae Hutchison (Belles), Betty Luna (Blue Sox), Carolyn Morris (Peaches), and Amy Irene Applegren (Lassies), while Connie Wisniewski (Chicks) and Dorothy Wiltse (Daisies) topped the league in earned run average with 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. As a result, more than half of the circuit's players averaged under .200. Dorothy Kamenshek (Peaches) was the only hitter to reach the .300 mark (.316).\n\nFollowing her baseball career, Shively graduated from Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and worked as a physical education teacher at Washington High School in South Bend, Indiana. She also coached the school's softball and volleyball teams to city championships, inspiring children for almost 30 years. Twila Shively died in Douglas, Michigan on Thanksgiving Day, 1999 at the age of 79, after suffering four years of Alzheimer's disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer. She is part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, unveiled in 1988, which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual personality.",

    "evidence": "Lieutenant Junior Grade Tetsuzō Iwamoto was one of the top-scoring aces among the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force (IJNAF) fighter pilots. He entered the Imperial Navy in 1934 and completed pilot training in December 1936. His first combat occurred over China in early 1938, and he emerged as the top naval ace of the campaign, credited with 14 aerial victories. Subsequently, he flew Zeros from the aircraft carrier Zuikaku from December 1941 to May 1942, including at the Battle of the Coral Sea. In late 1943, Iwamoto's air group was sent to Rabaul, New Britain, resulting in three months of the hardest air combat ever undertaken by the IJNAF against air raids mounted by U.S. and Allied air units. Subsequent assignments were Truk Atoll in the Carolines and the Philippines, and he was commissioned an Ensign in October 1944. Following the evacuation of the Philippines, Iwamoto served in home defense and trained Kamikaze pilots. Like many Japanese veterans, Iwamoto was reported to have fallen into depression after the war. His diary was found after his death, with claims of 202 Allied aircraft destroyed. As a result of the Japanese use of the British naval practices, the IJNAF scoring system was based on the system the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force (RAF) adopted from World War I until World War II. This system differed from the scoring system used by the U.S. Navy Air Force and U.S. Marine Air Force during World War II. Dr. Izawa and Professor Hata estimated the figure at about 80 or more than 87 in their research work in January 1971. In December 1993, Izawa wrote that Iwamoto was \"virtually\" the top ace of the IJNAF. As of mid-1944, there remained only two IJNAF fighter pilots who were credited with over 100 victories. Depending on various totals cited, Tetsuzō Iwamoto or Hiroyoshi Nishizawa was Japan's best ace. Iwamoto was known as the Chūtai leader (flying company, squadron of 8 to 16 fighters). Iwamoto was one of few survivors of the IJNAF from the early part of the Second World War. He fought over the Indian and the Pacific Ocean from north to south, and trained his young pilots even in the last months of the war.",

Baird signed for Aberdeen before the Second World War, but the war started before he had made the first team. He joined the British Army, but was captured and held as a prisoner of war. He escaped and lived with an Italian family as their \"son\". In 1989, he published an autobiography, \"Family of Four\", which described these experiences. Baird returned to Aberdeen before the end of the war. His good form in this period earned him selection for Scotland in a friendly match against Belgium in early 1946. Baird was one of nine Scotland players making their international debut in the match, with only Jimmy Delaney having significant experience. Of those nine debutants, five players did not make another international appearance, including Baird. Baird helped Aberdeen win the Southern League Cup (a forerunner of the Scottish League Cup) in 1946 and the 1947 Scottish Cup, but his appearances were restricted by injuries. In all, he made 104 league appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 26 goals in those matches. He was transferred in 1953 to St. Johnstone, where he played for three seasons before retiring in 1956. After retiring as a player, Baird worked as a teacher and a sports journalist. Baird celebrated his 90th birthday in May 2009, and died quietly in his sleep on 3 November 2009.",

This epic effort brought to light the main contents of the book, a wealth of botanical information on Malabar that had largely remained inaccessible to English-speaking scholars, because the entire text was in the Latin language. Despite the existence of Hendrik van Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus over the last three centuries, the correct taxonomic identity of many plants listed in Hortus Malabaricus, their medicinal properties, methods of use, etc., as described and codified by renowned traditional medical authorities of 17th century India remained inaccessible to English language-based scholars, until Manilal commenced publication of research papers and books on Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal's efforts ultimately resulted in an English edition of Hortus Malabaricus, for the first time, 325 years after its original publication from Amsterdam. The English edition contains a word-by-word translation of all the twelve volumes of the book, retaining the original style of language. Medicinal properties of plants are translated and interpreted, with commentaries on their Malayalam names given by van Rheede. In addition, the correct scientific identity of all plants, acceptable under ICBN, are set out along with their important synonyms and basionyms. Whilst the scope of Manilal's contributions to botany extend far beyond the research and publications around Hortus Malabaricus, his research work on Hortus Malabaricus alone are of botanical and socio-historic significance, and can be broadly classified under two heads: botanical and medicinal aspects of Hortus Malabaricus; and historical, political, social, and linguistic aspects of Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal has over 198 published research papers and 15 books to his credit as author and co-author. He and his associates have credits to discovering over 14 species of flowering plants, varieties, and combinations new to science. Manilal is the founder president of the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT).",

She maintained these fictions throughout her professional life. The year before she died, she finally admitted this story was not true, and records located since her death have confirmed her true origin.",

An eminent administrator, writer, orator, and innovator, Dr. C.V. Ananda Bose pioneered pathbreaking administrative innovations in rural development, affordable housing, eco-tourism development, redressal of public grievances, women's empowerment, development of weaker sections of society, and promotion of art and culture. The innovations have found expression in various developmental programmes that have been executed at the district, state, and national levels in India.\n\nIt was in the area of low-cost housing that Dr. Bose pioneered a movement that won international acclaim. He set up the first Nirmithi Kendra (building centre) in the country in the Kollam district, which became the institutional mechanism for the propagation of cost-effective, environment-friendly (CEEF) building technology. This was positively evaluated by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Government of India (1993). Based on the Kollam model, the Government of India launched the National Building Centre Movement to replicate Nirmithi Kendras (building centres) in every district of the country. The Nirmithi Movement was adjudged by the United Nations as one of the global best practices in the field of sustainable human settlement development.\n\nEarly in his career, Dr. Bose introduced the \"Gramotsava\" programme in Kerala, wherein the local people were encouraged to actively participate in the village development planning. The initiative, launched in the Kasargode district of Kerala in the 1980s, was subsequently implemented in 200 panchayats across the state. Dr. Bose also founded the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in the Kollam district during his tenure as Collector. The Council generated high tourism interest in the region and created new job opportunities for the local people. The Government of Kerala subsequently set up similar councils in all 14 districts of the state. DTPs have made perceptible contributions in positioning Kerala as \"God's own country\".\n\nHe later pioneered an eco-village programme in the Mannanan village of the Kottayam district of Kerala, wherein the family clusters were encouraged to pursue activities such as organic farming, soil and water conservation through traditional methods, floriculture, horticulture, vermiculture, generation of energy from non-conventional sources, homestead forestry, etc., with institutional support, governmental assistance, and financial support from different agencies.\n\nAs Chairman of the Atomic Energy Education Society, Mumbai, Dr. Bose introduced and reinforced the concept of alternative education, wherein people could pursue studies in disciplines in which they did not have prior academic backgrounds. He founded the Institute of Alternative Education. He also launched the ASTER Project (Application of Science & Technology in Educational Reforms) which sought to alter the mode of academic delivery through the application of information and communication technology (ICT).\n\nAs Managing Director of NAFED, Dr. Bose initiated a few innovative programmes which helped control the price spiral during 2009-10. Christened as \"Farm Gate to Home Gate\", this innovation sought to buy agricultural produce directly from the farmers for distribution among the consumers, taking only marginal profit. Spurred by the success of this pilot programme in New Delhi, the Easy Market Scheme was envisaged for price control in the rest of the country.\n\nAs the administrator of the National Museum, Dr. Bose launched a 100-day programme which spelt out specific measures to revamp and revitalise the institution. Most of the improvements suggested were achieved in 60 days, such as opening the closed-down galleries, modernising the display and lighting, launching outreach programmes to take the museum to the community, arranging children's programmes to ignite young minds to the greatness of India's national heritage, organising international exhibitions, and launching the People's Museum Movement, to mention a few.\n\nPursuit of excellence was always central to Dr. Bose's role in public administration.

    "evidence": "Robert Holgate (1481/1482–1555) was Bishop of Llandaff and then Archbishop of York (from 1545 to 1554). He recognised Henry VIII as head of the Church of England. Although a protégé of Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, Holgate had a career in the Gilbertine Order of which he became Master. Most of the Gilbertine houses were lesser establishments which should have been dissolved under the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535 (only four out of twenty-six houses had revenues over £200 a year). However, Holgate is credited with using his influence to save them for a few years. For example, Malton Priory, one of the lesser Gilbertine houses, was the last of them to surrender in December 1539, whereas Sempringham Priory, worth more than £200 a year, surrendered in 1538.\n\nIn 1550 Holgate married Barbara Wentworth, who was about 25 at the time. This may, however, have been a second marriage to make it fully legal, and Holgate and Wentworth may have first married in late 1547 with Roger Tongue officiating. In 1551 Arthur Norman claimed that he was already married to Barbara Wentworth, but the courts decided that their marriage when she was about seven had not been a binding legal transaction. Robert and Barbara remained married until 1553, when shortly after Mary I of England came to the throne she imprisoned Holgate on various charges, with his being a married clergy being central to these. In 1554 Holgate renounced his marriage claiming he had only entered it to avoid suspicion as a papist.\n\nIn January 1555 Holgate was released from prison, but he was not restored to priestly office. He died later that year. In 1558 a Robert Holgate from Yorkshire entered the University of Cambridge. He may have been a son of Holgate, since there are some claims he had two children by Barbara, but there is no conclusive evidence on the matter.",

    "evidence": "Mackenzie Caquatto (born March 26, 1992) is an American artistic gymnast. She was formerly on the US National Team. Her younger sister, Bridgette Caquatto, was also an elite gymnast on the senior US National Team. She first qualified as an elite gymnast in 2007 and competed at the 2007 US National Championships, where she finished 17th. Mackenzie competed as a senior for the first time at the 2008 US National Championships and placed 10th overall. She was selected to be a member of her first national team and qualified for the 2008 US Olympic Team Trials, but competed only on the first day of competition, placing 12th in the all-around on that day.\n\nIn 2009, Caquatto competed at her first international meets as a member of the national team. Caquatto suffered a knee injury shortly after, but managed to place 5th at the 2009 US National Championships. She was then invited to the World Championships Selection Camp and was named as the first alternate for the team. In addition to her status as an alternate, she was sent to the Toyota International in Toyota City, Japan. At this competition, she competed on the uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise, winning the silver medal on the uneven bars with a score of 14.675, only behind world silver medalist on the event, Koko Tsurumi of Japan.\n\nCaquatto started her 2010 season by competing at the City of Jesolo Trophy, where she had the highest beam score but made mistakes on the floor which kept her from medaling in the all-around. Caquatto competed at the 2010 CoverGirl Classic and placed 3rd in the all-around, scoring the second highest on vault and the uneven bars but falling from the balance beam. She had qualified to compete at the 2010 US National Championships. At the 2010 US National Championships, Mackenzie placed 5th in the all-around. She fell on a simple change grip skill on the uneven bars, her best event, placing 4th. After the US Nationals, Mackenzie was selected to attend a selection camp for the 2010 World Championships. From there, she advanced to the second camp where she won the all-around competition. She was eventually selected to compete.\n\nAt the World Championships, Mackenzie competed in the all-around in the qualifying round. After hitting all her routines without major error, she placed 9th individually and 3rd with the team. Although the top 24 qualifiers advance to the individual all-around final, she was left out because fellow American athletes Aly Raisman and Rebecca Bross had qualified ahead of her and only two athletes from each country can qualify to a final. After the qualifying round, Mackenzie was selected to compete on the uneven bars and the vault during the team finals. She contributed a 14.666 on the bars and a 15.000 on the vault to help the team win the silver medal behind Russia and ahead of China.\n\nShe competed as a Florida Gator at the NCAA level for the 2010–2011 season, where she became injured but still competed in the all-around for her team at the NCAA Championships. After finishing the NCAA season, Mackenzie decided to train for a comeback to elite gymnastics for the 2011 season. Mackenzie began her 2011 elite season by competing at the CoverGirl Classic. At the classic, she competed a slightly watered down balance beam routine and a solid uneven bars routine, scoring 14.100 and 14.750, respectively.\n\nAt the 2011 US Visa National Championships, Mackenzie surprised many by competing in the all-around. On day 1 of the competition, Mackenzie was in second place after the two rotations; after scoring a 14.700 and 15.000 on vault and uneven bars, respectively. Unfortunately, she counted her first fall on the balance beam. After having a solid floor exercise, she finished her night in sixth place with an all-around score of 56.000. On the final day of competition, Mackenzie competed solidly on all her events. Taking advantage of injuries to defending national champion Rebecca Bross and Chellsie Memmel, Mackenzie went on to finish the championships in fourth place behind Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, and champion Jordyn Wieber. She also took second place on the uneven bars just behind Wieber by 0.050.\n\nMackenzie was given a spot on her fourth national team and was invited to compete at the first World Team Selection Camp. She was considered to be a likely pick for the World Team, but injured her ankles when dismounting the beam at the selection camp and therefore lost her chance of going to Tokyo. After sitting out the beginning of the NCAA season, she competed on the uneven bars in early 2012 and is expected to reintroduce her beam routine soon.",

On July 15, 1845, along with four pastors, Grabau founded \"The Synod of the Lutheran Church Emigrated from Prussia\" (German: \"Synode der aus Preussen ausgewanderten lutherischen Kirche\"), which became known as \"The Buffalo Synod\". Grabau also founded the Martin Luther College in Buffalo. Grabau retained control of the Martin Luther College and remained as its rector. The official organ of Grabau's synod after 1866 was \"Die Wachende Kirche\", under his editorship. Grabau was married on July 15, 1834, to Christine Sophia Burgraf, the daughter of Johann Andreas Burggraf and Friedericke Louise Elizabeth Beulke. They had at least three children: Johann, Wilhelm, and Beata. Grabau died on June 2, 1879 in Buffalo, New York, shortly before the 40th anniversary of his arrival in the United States.",

He averaged a double-double (19.3 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game) during his seven-year tenure with the team, and he appeared as an NBA All-Star four times. While with the Knicks, Naulls was also the first African-American player to be named captain of a major professional sports team. During the 1962-63 NBA season, the Knicks traded Naulls to the San Francisco Warriors, who then traded Naulls to the Boston Celtics. Naulls would spend his last three professional seasons with the Celtics, winning three NBA championship rings in the process. He was a member of the 1964-1965 Celtics team that was named one of the ten best teams in the NBA at the 50th anniversary of the association. Upon retiring in 1966, he had tallied 11,305 career points and 6,508 career rebounds.

    "evidence": "Terence Michael Alderman (born 12 June 1956 in Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia) is a former Australian cricketer who played primarily as a right-arm fast-medium bowler of limited pace but nagging accuracy and movement. He began his first-class career in 1974 with Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield and came to international prominence when he was chosen for the Australian national team to tour England in 1981. In that series, he took 42 test wickets, including nine on debut, the biggest haul in a series since Jim Laker's 46 in 1956 and the fourth-highest total of all time. Alderman's 42 wickets is the record for the most wickets taken in a series without taking 10 wickets in a match. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the Almanack's 1982 edition. He was disabled from playing for over a year by a shoulder injury sustained on 13 November 1982 when he rashly tackled an English-supporting ground invader at the WACA Ground in Perth. Alderman took part in an unofficial Australian tour of South Africa in 1985–86 and 1986–87, when that country was banned from test cricket as a Commonwealth anti-apartheid sanction. As a result, he received a 3-year ban from international cricket which disqualified him from playing in the 1985 Ashes series in England. Following his suspension, Alderman returned to the Australian side and resumed his success against England, taking 41 wickets in the 1989 Ashes series and another 16 in the 1990–91 series, his final Ashes appearance. He rarely enjoyed similar success against other countries. His final test series was against the West Indies in 1990–91, where he ended his career with 170 test wickets. He was a poor batsman, passing fifty just once in his career and averaging barely eight in first-class cricket. He had three seasons in English county cricket, with Kent (1984 and 1986) and then with Gloucestershire (1988). He now works as a courier for Mercury in Western Australia. On 28 July 2000, Alderman was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for being the all-time leading wicket taker for Western Australia. Alderman's sister Denise Emerson is married to former test umpire Ross Emerson and herself played seven tests for the Australian women's cricket team.

    "evidence": "Sir John Russell Reynolds, 1st Baronet (22 May 1828 – 29 May 1896) was a British neurologist and physician. Reynolds was born in Romsey, Hampshire, as the son of John Reynolds, an independent minister, and the grandson of Dr. Henry Revell Reynolds. He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851, he graduated M.B. in the University of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852, he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a Fellow of the College in 1859. In the same year, he was appointed Assistant Physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 Assistant Physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865, he became Professor of the Principles and Practice of Medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen's Household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 Vice-President of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian Lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian Oration in 1884, and was elected President in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a Baronet. In the winter of 1895–96, he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as President of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children. The \"Reynolds Baronetcy\", of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death. Reynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an \"Essay on Vertigo\"; in 1855 \"Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves\", as well as \"Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain\"; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 \"Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity\"; in 1872 \"The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity\"; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the \"System of Medicine\", in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write – compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a \"Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe\". Reynolds was a tall man, with dark hair, with a dignified delivery and some oratorical power. Reynolds died in London.",

    "evidence": "Twila Shively (March 20, 1920 – November 25, 1999) was an American competitive baseball player. An outfielder, she played from 1945 through 1950 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5'2\", 128 lb., she batted and threw right-handed. Shively spent five of her six years in the AAGPBL playing in the left field. A solid defensive player, she showed speed, good hands, an accurate throwing arm, and lived in a constant state of readiness. Routinely, she ranked among the top defensive outfielders in several categories, until a severe ankle injury limited her ability to perform, and she had to switch to first base. Offensively, she made consistent contact, knew when to take the extra base, and excelled as a basestealer.\n\nBorn in Decatur, Illinois, Twila Shively was the daughter of Glenn and Eva (née Bryant) Shively. She began playing softball at age eight and moved up in the softball ranks in Chicago as early as 1942. By then, she was featured in an article signed by Carl Guldager and published in the Chicago Daily News with the headline: \"She's Hedy Lamarr of Softball, Twila Shively Looks Like Model, Runs Bases Like Ty Cobb. Has Baseball Savvy Plus Pretty Face\". In 1944, Shively became a member of the Rockola Chicks team of the newly formed National Girls Baseball League. The NGBL was organized in Chicago to keep the best local players from migrating to the AAGPBL, which had been stabilized in 1943. After that, both circuits competed against each other to see who could associate itself with the biggest stars.\n\nShively entered the AAGPBL in 1945 with the Grand Rapids Chicks, playing for them three years before joining the Chicago Colleens (1948) and Peoria Redwings (1948–1950). In her rookie year, she formed part of a Chicks outfield that included Thelma Eisen in the center field and Elizabeth Wicken at right field. Shively collected a .196 batting average and a .276 on-base percentage in 106 games, driving in 23 runs and scoring 42 times, while her 46 stolen bases ranked her fifth in the league. She also led all outfielders with a .968 fielding percentage and finished second for the most putouts (234) behind Fort Wayne Daisies' Penny O'Brian (236). During the regular season, she achieved a career highlight, when she belted a two-out, walk-off grand slam to give her team the victory.\n\nHer most productive season came in 1946, when she posted career numbers in average (.247), runs scored (78), hits (101), runs batted in (45), steals (45), and games played (111). Considering the year was great for many pitchers, her numbers were quite respectable. Four no-hitters were recorded by Anna Mae Hutchison (Belles), Betty Luna (Blue Sox), Carolyn Morris (Peaches), and Amy Irene Applegren (Lassies), while Connie Wisniewski (Chicks) and Dorothy Wiltse (Daisies) topped the league in earned run average with 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. As a result, more than half of the circuit's players averaged under .200. Dorothy Kamenshek (Peaches) was the only hitter to reach the .300 mark (.316).\n\nFollowing her baseball career, Shively graduated from Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and worked as a physical education teacher at Washington High School in South Bend, Indiana. She also coached the school's softball and volleyball teams to city championships, inspiring children for almost 30 years. Twila Shively died in Douglas, Michigan on Thanksgiving Day, 1999 at the age of 79, after suffering four years of Alzheimer's disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer. She is part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, unveiled in 1988, which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual personality.",

He escaped and lived with an Italian family as their \"son\". In 1989, he published an autobiography, \"Family of Four\", which described these experiences. Baird returned to Aberdeen before the end of the war. His good form in this period earned him selection for Scotland in a friendly match against Belgium in early 1946.

Of those nine debutants, five players did not make another international appearance, including Baird. Baird helped Aberdeen win the Southern League Cup (a forerunner of the Scottish League Cup) in 1946 and the 1947 Scottish Cup, but his appearances were restricted by injuries. In all, he made 104 league appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 26 goals in those matches. He was transferred in 1953 to St. Johnstone, where he played for three seasons before retiring in 1956.

As a 6'2\" forward for Orange Coast College, Vallely averaged 26 points per game and broke 18 scoring records. He was selected a Junior College All American. He dribbled with his left hand and shot with his right hand, and was especially good at shooting an outside jump shot.\n\nVallely was an integral member of the Bruins' backcourt after transferring from Orange Coast College in 1968. He was quick to make the transition from forward to guard at UCLA. In his first season, he was the Bruins' third leading scorer (12.9 p.p.g.) and adapted smoothly to head coach John Wooden's \"attack and gamble offense\". He was a member of the UCLA teams that won national titles in the 1969 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament and the 1970 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Vallely majored in economics at UCLA and had a 3.36 grade point average as a junior. He was selected to the twelve-man 1968 Olympic trials team coached by Jerry Tarkanian which competed in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nHe was taken by the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the 1970 NBA Draft. He sat on the bench much of the time, playing behind Pete Maravich, Lou Hudson, Walt Hazzard, and Herm Gilliam. Vallely was acquired by the Houston Rockets in November 1971 along with 6'7\" forward Jim Davis.",

    "evidence": "Nate Saint (August 30, 1923 - January 8, 1956) was an evangelical Christian missionary pilot to Ecuador who, along with four others, was killed while attempting to evangelize the Huaorani people through efforts known as Operation Auca. Nate Saint was born in 1923. When he was seven, he took his first plane ride with his brother Sam, who would eventually become a commercial pilot for American Airlines. While in the airplane, he discovered a love of flying. His family was somewhat unusual; his brothers made a sleeping patio on the roof of their home, and his dad built a roller coaster in the backyard.\n\nWhen he joined the army, he was stationed in Las Vegas, NV, but was transferred to several other locations over the years. A leg injury from a sledding accident caused him some problems while he was in the army. About a year before he was discharged, he almost died while climbing a mountain in Yosemite National Park. After that incident, he learned to live life to the fullest.\n\nIn September 1955, Nate was joined by his teammates, Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Pete Fleming, and Roger Youderian. Saint finally found a settlement of the Huaorani, also known as Aucas, while searching by air. To reach the tribe, Saint and the team lowered gifts to the Huaorani in a bucket tied to the plane. The Huaorani were widely feared by other Ecuadoreans, because they combined a desire to be left alone with a willingness to use force; they attacked and killed any intruders without provocation. Nevertheless, the tribe was excited on receiving the gifts and gave some gifts back.\n\nFinally, the missionaries decided to try to meet the Huaorani on the ground; and, on January 3, 1956, using the beach as a landing strip, they set up camp four miles from the Huaorani settlement. Their initial contact was encouraging; however, on Sunday, January 8, 1956, the entire team was killed on the beach (known as \"Palm Beach\") when armed Huaorani met and speared them.\n\nSaint and the other four men became famous worldwide as a result. \"Life\" magazine published a 10-page photo essay on the story, which was also covered in Reader's Digest and many other publications. Today, a small school for missionary children in Shell, Ecuador, bears Nate Saint's name. Rachel Saint, Nate's sister, continued the mission efforts to the Huaorani, which eventually came to fruition. This resulted in many of these natives becoming Christians, including those who had killed Saint.\n\nIn 1966, Marjorie (Marj) Farris Saint married Abe Van Der Puy, president of HCJB World Radio. Abe died in 2003; and Marj died in 2004, from cancer. She is buried in Hillcrest Memorial Gardens, south of Ocala, Florida. Nate's older son, Steve Saint, spent time as a child visiting his missionary family members and friends and getting to know the Huaorani. Steve was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ by Mincaye, who was the very man who killed his father but later converted to Christ. Steve Saint now works with the Huaorani people and travels around the world, preaching the gospel, often accompanied by Mincaye.\n\nA documentary based on the story, \"Through the Gates of Splendor\", was released in 2005. The following year, a feature film, \"End of the Spear\", was released on January 20, a week and a half after the 50-year anniversary of the killings. Steve Saint also helped write \"Jungle Pilot\", based on his father's diary about his time in Ecuador and work with the Huaorani Indians.",

    "evidence": "Archie Baird (8 May 1919 – 3 November 2009) was a Scottish association football player who played for Aberdeen and St. Johnstone. He was also capped once by the Scotland national football team. Baird was born in Rutherglen. Baird signed for Aberdeen before the Second World War, but the war started before he had made the first team. He joined the British Army, but was captured and held as a prisoner of war. He escaped and lived with an Italian family as their \"son\". In 1989, he published an autobiography, \"Family of Four\", which described these experiences. Baird returned to Aberdeen before the end of the war. His good form in this period earned him selection for Scotland in a friendly match against Belgium in early 1946. Baird was one of nine Scotland players making their international debut in the match, with only Jimmy Delaney having significant experience. Of those nine debutants, five players did not make another international appearance, including Baird. Baird helped Aberdeen win the Southern League Cup (a forerunner of the Scottish League Cup) in 1946 and the 1947 Scottish Cup, but his appearances were restricted by injuries. In all, he made 104 league appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 26 goals in those matches. He was transferred in 1953 to St. Johnstone, where he played for three seasons before retiring in 1956. After retiring as a player, Baird worked as a teacher and a sports journalist. Baird celebrated his 90th birthday in May 2009, and died quietly in his sleep on 3 November 2009.",
